road to pregnancy and why feminism is terrible				 ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage ali wonghi hello welcome thank you thank you for coming hello hello we are gonna have to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in like ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for comingum its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that uh i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating throughand then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find outum i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like you never know when you might need this and i was like but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of successi grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh hes– hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was like oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had we had so much chemistry he was like hey wassup i was like wassup and we– the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like hey can you drop me off i was like where he was like at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like oh no i just fucked a homeless dude againmy husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude you know you feel like youre in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and its very you know its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement you know just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im like i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer you knowbut i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on you knowmy last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its like making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre like i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes fromi think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was like its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abusedi grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats like a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were like oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the househim and i had been dating for four years and i– i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre like im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always like oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i waspeople are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you– like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be like we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre like but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn ita lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be like look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im like that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retiredi do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day like youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre like oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they wantyou know its– its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was like you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit togethermy fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was like why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just lets redecoratei gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a– im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to youi broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like uh youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really you know freaked out about anal and theyre like oh i dont wanna do that im scared of– of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre– if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel like youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like oh my god its like im going back in time♪ a whole new world ♪it was magicala big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your– just give your man a little– a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont– no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye like hes discovered nirvana and its like youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you knowmy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when– when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right im like yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their– glasses always means the woman wants some– its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just– just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what

lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cuntim just waiting for the right moment

and just keep on walking like a princessi have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteranso i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres– none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be like guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become– youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was like yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won you knowanother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was like yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and you know why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were like yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn– i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im like oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here you knowi need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre like im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their– their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevityi also decided to have a kid because uh im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it– and it scared me like im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im– im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats– thats shit you do in your  ok when in– when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um yeah and most of the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom– shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was like no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was like yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyoncé he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though im– im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser söze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you– that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channeli can already see how theres like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommyyou know i– i– i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big– they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing itnow that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my– my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporinso you know i– i in– previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnantall right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank youmoreali wong standup

college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said okay anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit like we talked about she said okay well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said okay anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money like we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said okay anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said you know goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck youthank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was like ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was like you know what my favorite memory was when i was like four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it like mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i like to test myselfi like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it like the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff like that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im like oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre like anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem like i worry about my career no you know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems like youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trendingno this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do you know what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understandnow im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im like fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say you know what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was like anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre like weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was like really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were like oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worrythis might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are like okay anthony well just so you know that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss okay and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even bettermoreanthony jeselnik standup transcripts share this article            				 thoughts on anthony jeselnik thoughts and prayers  – full

was a good boy hes just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat i dont understand i dont understand why a group like glaad right i always forget its gay lesbian a whatever the fuck it stands for all right why do they go after the old guy in the boat why dont they go after the people writing the book right hey could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages theyre not gonna do that thats the vatican theyre their own city they got a wall around their own city theyre brushing off cases of pedophilia like its nothing theyre not taking that call oh what happened really go fuck yourself click they dont care  i learned a long time ago i think whatever youre into youre into but im not into that religious stuff where– and this is why i actually walked away from my religion i had to be honest with myself one i didnt like to go– i didnt like going to church every week you know i just didnt part of it was im lazy i dont like getting up on sundays and the other part was i already heard all the stories okay heard them three four times the dude hasnt come back yet you know were just sort of mulching over the same shit here i got it – right –  and the other aspect was you know i actually– i had to be honest with myself i felt my religion made sense and everybody elses sounded stupid  i did look im not talking about the basis of every religion basis of every religion makes sense you know the ten commandments dont kill anybody dont touch my wife thats my bike right that all makes sense of which ive broken i think ive broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one thats it i havent killed anybody yet right but the murderous thoughts that i have sometimes i think i could do it like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers and theyre wearing those goldtoed like dress socks and they cross their feet at the ankles and they just start rubbing their feet together like i see the whole thing see the whole thing wrapping that sock shh shh shh right see the whole thing so well see still early on right but just the stories of how we got here and where were going and what happens after we die everybody elses religion sounded stupid you know like i live out in los angeles theres a bunch of scientologists out there and the first time i heard the story of scientology i was like that is the dumbest shit i have ever heard in my life  yeah like your guys name is ron ron and he wasnt alive thousands of years ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy was alive like   years ago he had a drivers license social security number theres like footage of him stubbing his toe motherfucker right i know what happened he was working at dennys he got sick of it ill start a religion hey everybody theres this spaceship coming back everybodys getting sneakers this is tom cruise were gonna try to make you clear right look im paraphrasing im paraphrasing to be fair to the scientologists i am paraphrasing but thats essentially what they believe in and i said that is the dumbest shit i ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water died and came back three days later so yeah that made total sense to me so it just hit me one day i was like why does that make sense and that shit doesnt you know they got a spaceship in theirs you know we– right we got the space shuttle you know theres sneakers theres a lot of shit i can relate to in this why does that sound so dumb to me you know what it is i think its cause i heard their story when i was an adult i heard my story when i was four years old right when i heard my story there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney giving me christmas toys if i lost a tooth there was a fairy there was the easter bunny why wouldnt there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever he did of course that made sense what happened was as i got older all of that stuff started to fall right ah son there is no fat fuck its your mother and i your moms the tooth fairy rabbits dont have eggs her tits are fake the nba is fixed bankers are cunts most of your dreams wont come true right and i was just like wow this is how the world is and meanwhile this shit was just floating this  gorilla of this fucking story i just had to make a decision what am i gonna do what am i gonna do with this am i gonna cling to it be that person thats very offensive to me and other christians and become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just yeah i kind of go a couple of times a year and like if my parents come to town i act like i go all the time and i dont go anymore or my last option which was basically just just let go of the shit you know just let go  just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call them is just sliding with that rock right just let me do this right just sliding and you think hes along for the ride the two of them theyre a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking that rock just keeps going this dude just stops thats what i did with my religion i just let go of it i didnt read a riot act to anybody i just let go of it and on the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures i just floated away  so now its like im in this weird place where im not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you know  id like to believe in something so ive been going around asking people what their shit is and i havent been able to find anything trying to be openminded i was doing a gig in helsinki and over there theyre like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die youre dead and thats it dead like a pigeon just– just layin there over blew my mind im like really youre just dead like my religion was you die and then you go up to get judged

terrifying dude i got to be honest i hate how scared im getting as i get older im developing all these new fears like i have a fear of flying now i never had a fear of it its not straightacrosstheboard flying i dont like small planes all of a sudden i just dont like them and it has nothing to do with the plane i believe in the planes okay i just dont believe in the pilots cause you know what i dont think the airline does either which is why that dude is flying that little plane the airline was basically like all right well give you like  people see how you do you know you fly them up you land you bring another  back well let you do this for a while you do this for a while we dont get any complaints no up and down up and down none of that shit well move you up to

shot at he cant bring this bus in its a joke right a bunch of people whining in the back my headphones dont work he doesnt give a fuck right hes up there sleeping hes trying to make something happen hes so goddamn bored thats a stud up there right so one time im flying into albany new york okay a city that nobody really goes to so im on a smaller plane and everything is going great all of a sudden out of nowhere we hit this turbulence  and it stops and everybody looks around laughing nervously like  all of a sudden it comes back with a vengeance you can literally hear the metal the planes made of like all of a sudden this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises whoa whaaa whoa whaaaa whoa im not gonna lie i have never been so fucking scared in my entire life dude that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child but turn around and see a  mustachioed male going whoo whaaa whoa dude the hair was standing up on my arms im praying to a higher power i dont even believe in the shit i just wish i had the balls to turn around and be like dude would you shut the fuck up jesus christ be a man push it down push it down deny your feelings act like you have answers do some man shit right now do some man shit jesus christ you know you think im not up here thinking whaaa whoa i am but how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house you know what kills me what absolutely kills me is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy marry him and make half whooo whaaaa fucking kids and you know what we become weaker as a species we do  do you remember back in the day when you watched the discovery channel about animals now they build cars but it used to be about animals right now its all car stuff looking forward to getting that carburetor today the carburetor didnt fit what do you mean the carburetor doesnt fit dads gonna be mad  theres never enough time to build the car its so fucking stupid we got to have this bus done by thursday or else what the guy doesnt want it anymore all right youll get the thing when we finish it okay this is a safety issue you want brakes on it then go get yourself some fucking lunch so before  before there used to just be animals and this is what i noticed everything from a lion all the way down to an insect okay if you had one drop of whoo whaaa bitchy blood in you none of the females would fuck you that was it your life was over your life was over no ant pussy for you your entire miserable eightday ant life cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew and the female ant saw it theyre like all right stay away from that one stay away from that one hes gonna jeopardize the whole hill and stacy listen to me human beings have empathy some woman will fall in love well hes nice he wears a sweater he likes to bake you know he lets me finish my stories which is all great qualities okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that youre rolling the dice youre rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over cause god forbid he picks your goddamn house this is the dude who has your back whos gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door and youre gonna turn around all youre gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window i dont know man thats risky you know in reality im being too hard on that guy yeah i am i am cause i was just as scared as he was except i didnt scream out like he did and thats simple the simple reason was this dude he was hugged too much as a child having people going how was your day whats wrong and all of that shit you know thats why i came down here i came out here to tell you guys you got to stop hugging your children you are ruining this country now you can hug your daughters you got to do that you got to do that hug those hooker shoes right out of them let them know that youre a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug them a little bit but every three four you got to fucking knock em down right come on it didnt hurt get up i didnt come from a family i dont know about you guys i didnt come from a touchyfeely call me when you get there mwah mwah none of that shit first time my mom hugged me i think was like once when i was little and when i moved out that was it and we only hugged cause we knew we were supposed to so we just tried to like it was like two parking meters came to life like we almost bumped heads it was horrific fucking horrific to this day sometimes i drive down the street and i think about that hug and its just so awful i have to like shout the memory out of my head ill just be driving down the street just be like aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head theres something about me like all my regret comes up when im in the shower i dont know what it is i think cause im in the shower and i have time to think and ill just think of shit i did in third grade where i just made an ass of myself and ill just be in the shower just being like  and my wifes always just like is everything okay in there ill just be like yeah yeah just accidentally turned on the hot water turned it on too much every day so yeah i actually asked my mother one time when i finally got out in the world and i saw how other families interacted i finally asked her how come we never did the hugging thing how come we didnt do that stuff she was like i wanted to hug you kids when you were little but i was afraid it was gonna make you gay and i was like you were afraid and she goes well it was your father thats what it was protecting him like i always do he was afraid he said you dont know how to raise boys and if you hug them thats whats gonna happen so in a marriage theres compromises yeah so she basically never hugged us cause my dad said if she did it was gonna make us gay and i got to tell you that was a great thing that my dad did for me let me finish before you start blogging okay and i end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle– sitting there next to some fucking cheetoeating blogger so yeah this is the deal im gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid as far as i know i dont have any kids as far as id think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didnt work so that was my dad as fucked up as that was that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about the way a veteran doesnt talk about going to war so i figure if that was his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have been something like dont change his shitty diaper let him figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let me handle this lady why are you still standing here you shit toddler so he took it from that and knocked it down to dont hug him its gonna make him gay right and then maybe someday i ever have a kid ill whittle it down to like hes not taking drama class all right hes not taking drama class cause i said so lady let me handle this i wont fix everything and thats not a homophobic thing either that i wouldnt send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it isnt i would send id let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son cant fucking do any of that shit unless im sending him to one of those fame high schools where everybodys doing it one of those creative schools you go to the cafeteria everybodys like  cottage cheese what is it made of  then he can do all he wants then he can do all the fuck he wants but theres no way im letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals hes gonna get the shit kicked out of him hes gonna come home with his underwear up his ass and then i have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like theres some sort of tomfoolery going on around here i dont want to do that i want to find the fucking eightyearold what is he this tall i want to find the kid that did it to my kid tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue right and just leave him there you wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know hes down to his last breath and then you turn him upsideright and you grab him by his throat you say something horrific you ever do that again im gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog all right  over so yeah a lot in my life has changed since i last came through here to atlanta i got married thats the big thing yes i did very happy about that im very happy because it was starting to get weird its like  years old my girlfriend yeah were gonna go out and get some pop going to parties it was just weird cause i hang out with people my age and they all got married they all had kids i just couldnt contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage marriages and kids i felt like a little kid just sitting there going like the superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal bipartisan with the middle eastern crisis its just its an advanced learning program the deadline is may  we have to stop the bullying with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate when the conversation would come around to me i felt like i was eight years old id just be like did anybody see the youtube video where the raccoon stole the cats food and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didnt care he just came in like this like george foreman and then he reached out he had hands all of a sudden he had hands i didnt know they had hands he scooped it up and he ran away on paws did you guys know they had hands so now im married so the next move is youre supposed to have a kid which i would love to do but im  years old im just thinking its too fucking late ya know come on man im gonna have a kid im gonna die of natural causes when the kids in fifth grade throwing him a frisbee we used to use these on a saturday do a face plant my kids standing there mom dads sleeping again i feel hopelessly behind all my friends have kids most of my friends who have kids are cool but i got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid that i dont understand anything anymore you know those people the most basic shit hey man its kind of cold out today dude you dont understand you dont understand cold till you got a twoyearold with a mitten up his ass and youre trying to get chocolate off the other ones face all right all right i get it you have a more complex life but i still understand being cold teeth chattering kind of lets me know right mine just turned six mine just turned seven i just feel hopelessly behind so what im actually thinking of doing im thinking about adopting yeah absolutely recycle you know think globally act locally everything doesnt have to be brandnew you know its like when you redo your kitchen you got custom up top you got ikea down the bottom right id love to adopt its a great thing to do but if i do it im not telling any of my friends im just gonna show up with the kid one day just to piss em off mine just turned six mine just turned seven id love to just show up with an eightyearold like dominoes yeah now i get to tell you what you dont understand sevenyearold wait till they turn eight eight is such a funny age terrible twos try the instant eights bam theyre just there like with all their issues i should do it though i should adopt i think its a great thing to do and i already know what i want to get i do i want to get like an   always garaged good dentition do you know what i would love to do id love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop wouldnt that be amazing like find the kid that made this shirt just show up at the factory like hey come on bring it in bring it in you little maniac how you doing youre going back to the states lshaped couch flat screen tv get in the car the rest of you keep sewing but you youre coming home with me yeah dude how easy how easy would that kid be to raise after the hell hes been through all i gotta do is let him sit down i am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met just bring him home have a seat hell be like i get to sit down yeah lay down on the couch hell be like its like a cloud its like a cloud ill get him a bowl of fritos put on cricket or soccer one of those sweatshop sports i dont know the kid would love me so thats my first draft pick all right coming out of the gate with that in the second round id probably get like an  boy soldier ya know yeah shore up the offensive line you gotta protect the blindside thats how fucked up the world is theres little boys out there fighting in wars so thats a twofer i can drag him out of that hell give him something of whats left of his childhood and god forbid if the dollar ever collapses right shit goes south zombies take over i got backup everybody thinks im gonna be the problem meanwhile i got this sawedoff chuck norris standing next to me  kills confirmed fucking kills theyre not stories can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster you cant coach that right i got to be honest with you i feel like id have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider i might be nuts but i feel like i could come down on the sweatshop kid right i said get in there and clean up your goddamn room im getting sick of this shit goes for you too if you want but you youve been out of line all day mister dont even start that shit dont even start that shit you say that every time yes you do every fucking time you say that you know the answer you want me to say it again ill break it down to you you know why it is you want to know why cause you sew all right yeah you sew dude hes fucking killed people do you understand that no he doesnt he doesnt have to make his bed too no he doesnt because he doesnt sleep in the bed hes out in the bushes all night talking to himself freaking me the fuck out all right oh fuck you fuck you he scares me too he scares me too dont even start that shit you wanted a big brother and i got you one dont even start that shit all right all right youre right stop crying stop crying shouldnt have yelled at you i just thought i could fucking bring him in give him a couple of pop tarts i figured hed chill out fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows doing that full metal jacket shit no you cant give him back it doesnt work that way there he is there he is whats up buddy whats going on we were just talking about you just doing like a little surprise thing you feeling all right you feeling all right youre not looking through those eyebrows huh everything okay so i figure uh i dont know if ill do it maybe im too selfish i have no idea im all over the fuckin map do you know what i want to do right now i actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter man i do thats my latest thing you know why it is its cause i live in los angeles yeah and its an absolute clusterfuck when you go into land in that city just look out the window and just look at the complete lack of planning theres not even zoning laws theyll build like a skyscraper next to a house next to a gun range and then theres like a fucking daycare center right the city doesnt even work even when everything else works so god forbid the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens where you gonna go in a city like that see you guys are all right out here in atlanta youre all right i dont know maybe in atlanta might be crazy youre on the outskirts youre fine youre fine you dont live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath youre cool drink that water for a good  days la theres nowhere to go thats why i love the helicopter dude the helicopter is the ultimate fuck this im out vehicle all you gotta do is assess the situation zombie coming up the street fuck this this looks safe you just land it you could sit there hovering just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick yeah so i told my wife i want to fly a helicopter shes just like yeah no which i know that came from a place of love but it still kind of annoyed me just that she said that shit then i was just gonna be like oh all right thought i was gonna get to do that but you said no so there goes that hey what other dreams arent i gonna get to achieve like do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask yeah im still gonna do it im just not gonna tell her im just gonna go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when i get my license im not going to tell her im just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room shes just gonna be like what is that what is that for what does that mean yeah someday youll see someday youll see when the shit hits the fan and youre freaking the fuck out and im taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter what is that shut the fuck up and get in now you guys think im bullshitting im not im serious im  in on this and ever since i got into it im seeing helicopters everywhere i never realized how many helicopters there were driving down the street like henry hill looking up at them doing key bumps and shit theyre after me swear to god im seeing stories about them its just like that old advertising anecdote i never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until i needed a mattress and then all of a sudden theyre all over the place and then i bought a mattress and then it all went away its the same shit i saw this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy gave helicopter tours for  years–  years without incident hands the business off to his son the american dream i built it up for  years here you go son make the family and the family name proud all right dad i love you all right this poor kid five days in hes supposed to give a tour to a couple only the dude shows up the kid thought it was weird but hes like i need the money i gotta give him a tour right so he takes this guy up ten minutes into the tour the dude fucking jumped out yeah five days in five days in from the balloons and the cake we love you son keep the family tree going the traditional line five fucking days later this kid he probably barely had the speech down just sitting there flying the helicopter all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft thats orange county theres over  miles of beaches there put your seatbelt back on  miles of beaches was established as a county in  sir please dont open the door sir what are you doing sir no no dont dont stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck air traffic control i dont know whos on this frequency but you really need– somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter five days in so i read further into the story turns out the guy who jumped out he was  years old terminally ill he was in pain every day they couldnt figure out what was wrong with him and he had had enough at that point that guy immediately became a hero in my world know what i love about him not only did he make the decision he didnt go out like some pussy right handful of pills watching a romantic comedy wrapped in an afghan that nana made fuck that guy went out like a man take me up in a chopper im looking at the land i love and then im jumping out like a superhero i loved it yeah  this guy should have been wearing a fucking cape i cant imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life like fuck you disease i decide ripping tubes out gets a burger shotguns a beer take me up in the chopper he probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard hes not even listening to this guy giving the tour right over  miles of beaches put your seatbelt back on established as a county in  sir please dont try to open the door no no dont dont dont   incredible but heres the thing i left out one small thing there is one small thing the guy fucking lived yeah yeah they were out over the ocean  feet up youd think that would be enough so im thinking he must have gone in like greg louganis like no splash just but witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air so that sounds like a hell of an impact i think he accidentally did the most epic  belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter but that didnt change what he was trying to do where his heart was i still love this guy i just feel bad for him on the way down hes got to be thinking three more seconds of pain two more seconds wham  oh my god this is worse this is way worse it has a happy ending though he later died at the hospital thats right so heres to him god bless him i hope i have the balls someday so where do you go from there well as i mentioned last time i came through town i wanted to get a gun you know i do yeah but ive finally given up on that i gave up on that dream my wife doesnt want me to get one so yeah she didnt want– dude you got to pick your fucking battles im gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly i cant fucking have some  hanging around ill do whatever i want all right what i say goes eat it cant be that person now it fucking bums me out cause all i wanted to do was just get a  thats all i wanted perfect gun for home protection  caliber youre laughing at that sir thats not enough i dont know im down south what do you think thats not enough right you want– shotgun right  you guys are out of your minds youre out of your fucking minds let me ask all you gun guys who are gonna make fun if i had a  whats with your  that little queer gun do you keep it between your buttocks is that the holster is that what you do with your gay little gun you need a big gun all you fucking guys let me ask you this all you guys with your guns have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs have

glasses right you look at your spread or whatever and then you put it back in there right you ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs cause thats whats gonna happen when that intruder comes in youre not gonna have time to be hang on a second let me just yeah youre not gonna have time dude i shot a fiveshot  one time without earplugs i was landscaping this guys yard he comes out at the end of the job hey i got this fiveshot  you want to go down the street theres a burnedout car we can take a couple of shots you know whats funny every other state is fuckin dying laughing at this point in the joke because its so goddamn ridiculous until i get down to the south and you guys just sit here staring at me like all right so what happened pretty standard i thought this was gonna be a comedy show youre reading from your journal i dont understand what the– its not a real compelling story im mowing a fucking lawn and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says lets shoot it at a burnedout car okay jesus christ can we agree on that so im like all right lets do it fuck it so i go down there never shot a gun before i bring the gun up point it at the car i pull the trigger i saw the muzzle flash i felt a kick i never heard the gun i pulled the trigger all i just heard was  i shot the gun four more times never heard it didnt get louder didnt get quieter just kept seeing flashes  all right so lets take one of your fucking guns lets just say for the sake of argument all right you got that thing sitting on a nightstand loaded right for gods sakes tell me you have it there dont be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there you got the thing fucking loaded ready to go   in the morning this is when the psychos coming in too right thats when they come in   in the morning they dont come by at  at night as youre cutting into a pork chop im out of my mind im coming back in  minutes so stretch out your hammies cause its gonna get crazy thats not how it works they wait till youre dead asleep   in the morning right before rem sleep is kicking in so lets just say for the sake of argument all you gun guys you got your thing loaded right your piece right right there loaded for bear youre lying there same scenario right one leg under the covers one without shirt  in the morning youre just  meanwhile some psycho sneaking in through the living room window right he brings in a fucking sickle and hes just listening listens all the way down that hall and he just hears  hes trying not to squeak on the floorboards and youre just fucking lying there  all of a sudden that little dog on the floor is just like   whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter boy you hear something whats the matter what are you barking for youre shaking whats the matter huh you hear something whats– come on man quit fucking around i got to go to work tomorrow  all of a sudden boom that door flies open you just see this shadowy figure you pick up that gun blam  and you fucking miss you miss you cant see now you cant hear thats two out of five senses what are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed youre still gonna be shooting over here meanwhile you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed takes off your head if you had the  you could still hear your ears would be ringing but you could hear that fucker coming across and you could shoot at him and he would leave he would leave you guys just wont get off the fact that its a fuckin  youre like psychotic with this shit all right no no no no no no no let me– i will extend an olive branch to you people okay i get it i get it that a  is basically a roidedup bb gun i got it okay i understand that if you actually want to kill somebody you have to basically have the gun up to somebodys head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger i understand that okay but i maintain i dont care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house i could defend my house with a bb gun i dont give a fuck how tough you are i dont care if i started shooting at you with a bb gun at the very least you have to go back outside and regroup thats a fact that is a fact if i caught you in your elbow that might be the end of your night look im coming back im coming back ive been trying to get along with my wife better im trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship im not turning out the pilot light though all right im keeping some fight in me im not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like i guess were making holiday cookies that dude with the bowed shoulders she makes them and then im supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them i dont even think they taste that good but just– no i stand my ground sometimes sometimes i let it go you just got to figure it out we had a fight the other night she got so mad at me she was like you can just sleep downstairs you can just sleep downstairs i couldnt believe it its one of the most arrogant things ive ever heard in my life one adult telling another adult where they can sleep you can just sleep downstairs like i was just gonna sit up in bed grab a blanket like linus all right hey where downstairs by the way like over here downstairs or like more over here where should i sleep its like are you out of your mind i go im not sleeping downstairs shes like where you gonna sleep then im like where i always sleep i will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if i want to what are you gonna do im bigger than you ill hang onto the covers try to get me out no tickling go ahead yeah i was like you dont tell me where to sleep i sleep where i want to sleep shes like well you dont tell me where to sleep im like im not the one telling people where to sleep it was one of those classic relationship fights its like  in the morning youre both half naked shes not wearing a bra you got half a ball hanging out and another thing no no i need to say this the other day i felt slighted its fuckin unreal but what kills me is that theres actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit yeah you talk to them theyll be hey hows it been going its been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch you know how that is right no i dont i dont understand how did you get yourself into that situation like what are you afraid of what is she gonna do if you say no what is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table i understand if youre dating some woman and she does that ufc mma shit then you got to sleep where she says to sleep you got to shes gonna come at you well lets get you in an arm bar all right all right all right tapping out or even worse she chokes you out you wake up on the couch like  minutes later just grab your jacket off the back of the couch i fucking hate when she does this its like its not even fair have a debate like a normal person all right im gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here someone whos actually been sleeping on the couch okay so theres the first fear out the window okay she cant physically dominate you so thats gone whats the next fear shes gonna cut off the sex yeah rub one out neutralized its the most empty threat there is do it right in front of her join me yeah ive never understood that threat thats like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator but you got a sandwich in your pocket a neverending sandwich like some biblical shit like jesus with the fucking bread or whatever so now whats the last thing she can do what can she do now be moody you cant handle that walk by your tv without looking at you only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen who gives a fuck my wife does that i just sit there i just start commentating here she comes again walking by the tv she really must be mad shes never bodyslammed me once ever im not saying to be a dick all right im just saying you got to keep them honest every once in a while you got to have a little pushback hey hey hey hey hey rest of the shit– im learning that about women you just want to keep them calm just keep them calm like a rescue dog right just everythings cool everythings cool just yeah yeah yeah this is great this is great im having a great time no your friends are awesome your friends are awesome very interesting party i am talking to people im talking to people i am having a good time here thats what you do you just do that enough then when you bark back you got a little something heres an olive branch ive extended to her its basically we fight a lot over television ive kind of come her way shes come my way she watches a little bit of sports i occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which i dont care the nerds gonna fuck the cheerleader ill watch it right i dont mind them its an uplifting story i just dont like the love scenes in romantic comedies they creep me out theyre just so fucking nice its like missionarystyle theres candles that stupid saxophone music  it always goes down like the saxophone implies the penetration right cause they cant show it they got to make her this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the other  of her sexuality no hairpulling no assslapping none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a womans sexuality thats never brought up that whole hold me down but let me up but hold me down choke me but let me breathe but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit i want to feel your power but i want to be safe but let me know if you really wanted to that whole fifty shades of rape whatever the hell that is yeah i dont even pretend to understand it i remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit i didnt even know what she was doing i was just so psyched to be getting laid i was like and she just kept taking my hand and she kept putting it right here i didnt know what she was doing i thought she was testing my core strength or some shit and finally i was just like what are you doing she says like i dont know i just kinda like ya know its like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why dont you want to do it itll be fun why dont i want to do it i dont think i want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck having the cops show up yeah shes in here officer damndest thing it was her idea i swear to god it was her idea yeah they always make it nice in those movies the raciest thing theyll do is every once in a while theyll kiss up against a wall i guess women like walls i didnt know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing oh my god its the wall oh my god its supporting me maybe hell support me its a metaphor i love it yeah i saw one the other night they were doing that and then out of nowhere they started having sex up against the wall

thank you guys have a seat feel comfortable relax i want to thank everyone in la for a wonderful week its been great here you know what its been ten years since the last time i played los angeles if you can imagine i know i know ive been gone for a very long time and unbeknownst to you it was a difficult ten years im not gonna take you through all the agony ive been through but it was tough some of it you mightve seeni dont know if you ever saw on tmz the big headline dave chappelle drunk onstage in detroit well if you saw it i wasnt drunk i had smoked some reefer with some rappers yeah i dont know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers but their weed is very strong stronger than i what i was accustomed to the article goes on to say i was booed offstage which is also incorrect i was booed i did not leave it was a long bomb it was a fucking nightmare two puffs of weed thats all it was two puffs i never had that happen where i take two puffs of weed i looked at the guy next to me i was like im gonna bomb n i g g a i can feel it and that guy called my name dave chappelle n i g g a s was like normally when you do a comedy show– you guys dont know what it looks like up here but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like thats how the show started didnt take long for their faces to switch up like what the fuck they started looking amongst themselves so i knew i wasnt doing good i dont remember what i was saying it just took one person to break the ice it was a black lady with a ford motor shirt on stood up suddenly fuck you dave chappelle i said excuse me she said i worked all week for this shit and this show sucks and in a weird act of racial harmony a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up yeah the whole crowd banded together and started chanting we want our money back we want our money back i said oh shit i snapped out of it good people of detroit hear me hear me now you will never get your fucking money back fuck that i said im like evel knievel i get paid for the attempt i didnt promise this shit would be good boo they said fuck youthis went on for a long time and then after the show i felt so bad i took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– i said im gonna give this to charity you know what i did i bought  worth of bubble gum and drove around detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry i was very mad at detroit that night because not only did i bomb i had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again fucking nightmarethat would be like if you were having sex with a woman and for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason she had a mousetrap in her pussy you get caught in the trap and then youve got to fuck her again tomorrow night id still do it but id be careful the next time the old mousetrapinthepussy trick eh fool me once yeah yeah it was a tough time and i wanted to give up sometimes i almost did give up but then right before i gave up i decided not to but i made the call they answered the phone hello dancing with the stars i said not yet not yet yeah if you see me on that shit its over trust me my spirit is broken if you see me waiting for them judges getting critiqued on my chacha fuck thative been hanging out in– i havent been working in la but i come out here and hang out and shit i was out here a few weeks ago i almost got arrested im not bullshitting this happens to a lot of black people what happened was i was coming out of one of those nightclubs in hollywood and my friend saw me i guess i was wobbling or something so he just rolled up hes a good friend of mine hes like hey dave give me the keys i was like all right n i g g a just take the keys and i got in the passengers side of my car and he drove it it was fine just talking chopping it up and then on the  the blueandwhites hit us now i should tell you the friend that was driving me was black which really doesnt have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car not my fear im black but im also dave chappelle so i figured you know shit will probably be fine traffic stop started off on the right foot the cops came up to the drivers side hi how are you guys doing tonight and he recognized me immediately oh dave chappelle and i looked at my friend like were getting out of this shit and then he says you guys were swerving in the lane do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second still no cause for alarm i looked through the rearview mirror the body language of the arrest looked good just talking so then i started fucking with the radio you know a traffic stop is going good if youre listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car but then when i looked back in the rearview mirror something had gone horribly wrong that motherfucker was back there like and the next thing i knew they were stuffing him in the back of the car and i thought what anybody would think in a situation like that oh my god what is gonna happen to me and the police walked up to the window mr chappelle we had to arrest your friend he refused to take our breathalyzer test i said that motherfucker not complying thats odd so officer whats gonna happen to me youre fine were just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle and well arrange for you to have a ride home i said oh well no i would rather you just give me the keys he said mr chappelle your friend already told us hes your designated driver we cant let you drive in this condition i was like no n i g g a im good and then suddenly the shit turned into vegas he was like ill let you blow for it i said excuse me he said if you blow in my breathalyzer– i said oh n i g g a i thought you was trying to get your dick sucked whats the– whew whew if you blow in my breathalyzer and pass ill give you the keys to the car i said uh set em up n i g g a lets play and i blew in that thing and it made a noise beep i said uhoh and he looked at it he said oh well mr chappelle i guess youre free to go i said i am i didnt know that thing didnt pick up weed i drove home on the miles an hour yeah it all worked out it all worked out im one of the lucky onesit doesnt work out that well for everybody i saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in la in traffic you see that shit on rush hour traffic they beat a black womans ass this woman didnt even do anything wrong its fucked up it was so fucked up it didnt even go to court the city of la just gave that woman  million for her pain and suffering that is not bad considering thats the same amount of money that marcos maidana made to fight floyd mayweather the second time and this woman obviously hasnt trained a day in her life you can see it on the tape she didnt come to fight her guards were low she was taking a lot of shotseverybodys mad at police now i watched that– you see that shit on netflix making a murderer the steven avery story if you havent seen it check it out steven avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the united states has ever been in in a justice system designed for him to thrive hes failed miserably twice i cant even wrap my mind around it if making a murderer was about a black dude that shit would be called duh of course everything would go wrong seems like he did it all right the motherfucker even had  for his legal defense that should get you off in wisconsin thats like oj money all he needed to get off that he didnt have was a single black juror thats all it wouldve took because only a black dude in the united states can look at other dudes and be like i think the police did this shit hes fucked up in the game thats how oj got offive been watching that new oj show i cant get enough of that shit doesnt it bring back good memories but i forgot just how polarizing that oj case was and you know ive met oj simpson on four different occasions in my life and before the end of the show i will tell you about each of those occasions the first time i met oj simpson i was in santa monica santa monica yeah i cant believe a black dude was like santa monica you the last n i g g a i would expect to say that let me see your shoes you got some vans on n i g g a what you got santa monica you at the time i was  i had done a show and the guy from the club came up and was like hey oj simpsons here and he said he wants to meet you i said what fuck yeah i ran down the steps and oj was down there hes like hey young man how are you its very good to meet you and youre doing really good work and i hope good things happen for you in your life i was like man thanks mr juice standing beside him was– i dont know the nice way to say this– his soontobeslain wife ladies and gentlemen man the fuck up or youre not gonna make it to the end of this show just man the fuck up shes dead we already know what happened we dont know who did it but we know what happened i should tell you that woman was very nice to me she actually embraced me she said i think youre adorable and she hugged me she goes good luck to you and she held me for a long time and i whispered in her ear bitch are you trying to get us both killed im just kidding i didnt say that but that was the first time in a nutshellits good to see so many so many different people here from so many different ethnicities very diverse crowd looks like you thought bernie sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker but surprise its me yeah yeah you know im happy really to see black people come a lot of black people dont fuck with me like they used to but theres a few reasons you dont see black people at my shows one is because obviously black people have slower internet connections i mean that would be my guess i dont know what– actually my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community i hold so deara couple of weeks ago i was supposed to be in flint michigan for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint i dont know if you know this but the water in flint is fucking poisonous its actually making people sick hollywood people are like so what at least they have water but this water– this water is fucked up so a lot of black celebrities flew into flint and they did a tremendous charity benefit and i was on the schedule to appearuh so the reason a lot of people havent heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the oscars right i know so i was on my way to the airport to go to flint and then chris rock calls me and is like hey dave i got a ticket for you for the oscars can you make it and i was like sure n i g g a im on my way to the airport right now come on man what am i gonna do about that water what am i a fucking superhero i need to have fun i need to live too i didnt fuck that water up stevie wonder was there they didnt need me im sorry everybody id never been to the oscars youve seen the movies i make i was excitedi knew i was gonna get into some trouble because when i was walking on the red carpet the black press came after me excuse me brother when you hear somebody call you brother too much something terrible is about to happen excuse me brother brother and i looked back and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie i said uhoh he said i just want to ask you a couple questions i said what publication are you with he said me im with the daily bongo i said daily bongo what the fuck who the fuck reads this he said listen brother i just want to ask you a quick question you understand that this year this is a boycott for the oscars so im just wondering what made you of all people cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight i said boycott n i g g a i havent been working in ten years what do you mean boycott ive been on strike yall n i g g a s didnt stop working i had to watch fucking key and peele do my show every night so fuck the daily bongo is what i said i went to the oscars and had a wonderful time i went in that fucking green room it was filled with so many stars i couldnt even believe what i was seeing hollywood was seducing me all over again i was sitting back there im smoking drinking with the starsand then two hollywood movie producers came over right to me oh my god dave chappelle said the leader one he was obviously gay some guys you can just tell the other one seemed like a money guy maybe he was from texas or some shit but the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking and then he hit me with so david um do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue the truth is i dont but if you know the game youre not supposed to tell motherfuckers you dont have ideas i was like yeah man i got plenty of ideas and he called my bluff really like what huh oh um umand then i just started making up shit that i thought maybe hed like to see i said i have a superhero idea he goes really i go yeah hes a– hes a gay superhero he was like really whats it called huh oh its called– its called same hero new boots its about a gay souschef in san francisco that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when hes taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams supersonic gay kind of powers and he starts saving everybody in san francisco but at first he only saves gay people later he saves everybody and the whole city just falls in love with him the only problem is no one remembers him when he saves them well i dont understand why wouldnt they remember him i said because dummy hes gay he keeps changing his outfit people come up– thanks for saving me sir whats your name anyway hes like same hero new boots and that motherfucker flies awayhe was like i like it a lot the texan didnt like that shit at all he was upset thats impossible a gay superhero i said what well i have others i have a superhero youd love cause hes stronger than superman and he fights for truth justice and the american way like superman but more than superman he beats up mexicans for no reason the texans like you got my attention im like man this motherfuckers so strong he can fly and do all this great shit only problem with this guy is he cant even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a womans vagina not a long touch just a couple of pats he said well whats the problem with that i said the problem sir is that our hero is not a handsome man and hes often short on cash so whenever trouble breaks out he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas please miss that buildings on fire can i pat your vagina quickly people are dying but he cant tell them exactly why eww get away youre gross please miss people are dying just a couple of pats eww gross get away so he rapes themi know i know thats the dilemma for the audience because he rapes but he saves a lot of lives and he saves way more than he rapes and he only rapes to save but he does rape i didnt realize it but the whole green room was looking at us all the celebrities were disgusted ohh that guy from texas was like heres my card call me on monday that worked outthe second time i met oj simpson it was right after the trial of the century there i was now a young man of probably  oj simpson was the most famous or infamous face on planet earth i was in a restaurant in beverly hills with my agents i wasnt alone in the restaurant but i was alone i was the only black person in the restaurant and in the s that felt very uncomfortable now i tend to enjoy it at this age i was having dinner with my agents celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative but i later learned fucking sucked and suddenly a group of women walked by every race was in that group black white asian latina white white and white again they were all gorgeous i watched them walk by then i saw a familiar face al cowlings the man from the infamous bronco chase walked by and embraced one of the women and they walked towards the door couldnt believe what i saw and then close behind him was oj simpson newly released from jail the restaurant fell still i was shocked i didnt mean to say it out loud but it just came out oj he stopped turned around to see who said it saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me i was sitting in the corner of the booth he leaned over all the white people i was having dinner with and shook my hand how are you young man he looked in my eyes and i could see in his eyes that he didnt remember meeting me the first time and then he walked away and i looked back at my agents and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named sharon who used to represent me how could you she said how could you shake hands with that murderer i said sharon with all due respect that murderer ran for over  yards and he was acquitted so you know fuck it the glove didnt fit the glove didnt fit get over yourself some people cant do thatsome people just cant get over themselves gay people have a hard time doing that recently here we go here comes the deep water no recently ive noticed that i noticed it with that manny pacquiao controversy yeah it was– now in the gay communitys defense manny pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people very not nice things that i wont repeat but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals it wasnt a good look nike took his shoes immediately which i thought was a little harsh a little harsh you know what i mean just cause hes asian you know what i mean how the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an asian dude to appease a gay dude you know what i mean no you dont know what i mean but asian people kind of know what i mean no no asians in the front no no this is what i mean look youre an asian dude– i say this with no disrespectwere all americans right and we can agree that america has a huge body count all over the world but nowhere more than asia literally if you look at history recently we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent we dropped two atomic bombs on fucking japan and theyve been drawing hello kitty and shit ever since theres a lot of ladyboys in the wake of our bombs and i know these things because my wife is asian shes filipino all right okay so that explains it now you know why you see me at all those filipino events im not there picking up pussy im dropping some off i take my wife to all that shit i took my wife to see pacquiao fight mayweather we sat ringside okay that– yeah that was a quiet car ride home thats what that wasbut if you know whats popping in the philippines you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the philippines growing up without their mothers yes a lot of women in the philippines go to the arabian peninsula they come to the united states they make all their money here they send all that money back home which is still one of the numberone staples in the philippines economy– money that the expats send back to the philippines the men on the other hand are left rearing children twiddling their thumbs waiting on their wives checks these men have been fucking emasculatedand then suddenly a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist this is not the guy youre supposed to ask what do you think of homosexuals hes not your champ shit thats why i dont have a sneaker deal cause if you say something that people dont like theyll take your fucking shoes offif martin luther king had a sneaker deal wed still be on the back of the bus its true the nike exec would come up– hi martin uh we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans its upsetting our southern distributors but i dont understand i thought thats why i had a sneaker deal in the first place not quite really its a walking shoe and we like the marching but try to understand fuck that shityou know i get it though i understand why gay people are mad and i empathize you know what im just telling you this as a black dude i support your movement but if you want to take some advice from a negro pace yourself these things take a while just cause they passed the law doesnt mean theyre gonna like it brown v board of education was insomebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last wednesday it takes a minute my wifes friend stewart told me that my wife has a lot of gay friends stewarts their leader she has a lot of gay friends and i dont like em not cause theyre gay im just judging them on the merits of their character theyre just not nice dudes theyre fucking rude houseguests theyre sitting on my couch giggling with my wife eating my motherfucking macaroons then i come in and they act like the partys over hey stewart whats going on this guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk hi david stewart whats all the beef man whats going– he always wants to have some kind of gay political argument the last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words husband and wife out of the law i said why would you want those words out of the law he said because it discriminates against samesex couples i was like n i g g a s please save me the semantics just trust me take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino youre about to crap out just go outside talk that over amongst yourselves and whichever one of you is gayer thats the wife no no stewart didnt like that stewart educates me about this movement i didnt even know shit about it he told me its called lbgtq i was like what the fuck is the q does that even make sense q turns out q is like the vowels that shit is sometimes y its for gay dudes that dont really know theyre gay like prison fags who are like what im not gay n i g g a im just sucking these dicks to pass the time im not g im q ugh i think– okay again of all those letters the t has the toughest road ahead in fact i think the t should stand for tough road aheadtheyve got the longest mental gap to bridge thats all im saying because whenever i see one of them ts on the street i dont mind them but ill be like man i miss bruce im sorry guys im  i remember bruce jenner before the kardashians before all that this motherfucker was a white american superhero it was amazing he was beating africans at track and field wed never seen anything like it he was on my cereal box growing up you know how much of that cereal i ate n i g g a i didnt know he was gonna do that i knew before you guys knew i

americans dont understand it theyll support it and let this person live a happy life is this whats happening if it is then good for america thats dave chappelle the american although dave chappelle the black american he was a little jealous i was like how the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination olympics if the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year thered be a fucking war in la i know black dudes in brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe transgenders are gangsters i used to do business

jackets or tattoos or something you sure thats what you want to do theres only way to find out n i g g a wutang pow pow lets go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us yeahthe third time i met oj simpson— the third time i met oj simpson i was doing great in life id just finished the second season of chappelles show man those were good days i was playing a comedy club in miami the improv i dont know if youve ever been but if you have youd know the door for the green room is right on the stage can you imagine such a thing if i walked out of the door of the green room bam i was right here right from the dressing room and i did that i walked out and the whole crowd was like hooray and i looked– maam as close as you are to me– i saw him as soon as i came out the juice and i saw recognition in his eyes and it filled me with pride that he knew who i was i didnt acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience and i didnt want to start a panic but i did my show the show went great i said good night everyone they all said yay and i didnt say nothing to oj but i just gave him the signal to let him know i knew he was there and i walked into the green room and oj was already in there i was like how the fuck is this possible i was scared and then my friends came in and we all started talking we sat down on the couch and im just telling you what i saw with my own eyes you can believe me or not believe me but in my experience oj simpson– one of the nicest men id ever met he was nice to me he was nice to my friends the conversation was filled with warmth and levity humor and wisdom we talked for minutes and then suddenly the juice said you know what ive got to be going but its good to see you again and im glad things went so well i said thanks juice and my friends said yeah goodbye mr juice they were new to the game he said no thank you for your hospitality good night guys and we said good night and he just walked out of the room and as soon as the door closed we all looked at each other like that n i g g a did that shit did you feel that i could feel like murder in the roomwell you young heads missed that shit youre all too young you dont remember that how old are you young man you twentyfour twentyfour you dont know shit you dont know shit you gotta google shit that i lived through see this is why i lock motherfuckers phones up seriously because the young kids you guys need to take a break from that– we all need to break just from that technology just for a minute you know im from a different time young man a dark time to you im from a time that i didnt even used to know who was on the phone until i answered the shit like when tragedy used to strikei remember i was  years old and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom you remember these days and she turned it on to one of three channels and she said class the space shuttle is taking off and were all gonna watch it take off man that shit was going great for like three to five minutes thats right you remember it fucking exploded right on television everybody on board dead immediately presumed dead it was so bad the teacher looked at all the kids and was like you can go home it was a goddamn national tragedy this was cold war america the russians were laughing at usmy point is for a guy your age wouldnt even know the pain because in your generation its like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing im getting over one cop shooting and then another one happens and then another one happens and another one happens im crying about paris and then brussels happens i cant keep track of all this shit so you just give the fuck up thats the hallmark of your generation and thats fucked up because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history this is the age of spin the age where nobody knows what the fuck theyre even looking at did you know that planned parenthood was for abortions its for people that dont plan things out at all thats right so a guy your age doesnt really know how he feels are you prochoice are you anticonsequences what does it all really mean its easier not to care for you but for us we were trained to care we were raised that wayi used to watch a fucking cartoon when i was growing up called care bears it was about a fucking group of teddybear people they were like teddy bears but they were like people and they were all different colors and they all fucking just walked around caring they cared about each other and everything else they all had different designs on their stomachs and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside very very loving group of beings and when shit got real bad as nice as those teddy bears were they didnt get mean faces they got determined hmm and the leader would say come on guys its time for the care bear stare remember that shit and them little teddy bears would lock arms and stare at the problem– and im not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests and would dispel anything that was fucked up and when we grew up we wanted to be like those bears and then we got our hearts broken because we found out that life wasnt gonna let us do that and that its impossible to shoot love out of your chesthowever i have shot love onto somebodys chest before i do it all the time its the next best thing you kids dont know your generation is just determined to be angry mad everybodys mad back when we were growing up only black people were mad now everybodys just trying to get in on the act i try to think to myself when did everyone get mad and then i realize this happened before we were born this is a long way to go but it probably started in the second world war think about it all these black men millions of black men leave the united states for the first time go over to europe with americas armed forces and fight the nazis and make more money fighting nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the united states and a lot of those men while they were in europe– just to be real not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women im sorry ladies and gentlemen this was world war ii europe and these were desperate times and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things and its very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after youve been in the south of france getting your dick sucked for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that thats a lifechanging experience and while that was happening in europe here in america for the first time women entered the workforce en masse by the millions all the men were gone someone had to run the factory the ladies did it thats right this was the first generation of american women to have independent income en masse and when the men came back the women werent the same american women had grown they were uttering phrases that no woman on earth had ever spoken before things like no and shut the fuck up and i dont feel like itand then behind the scenes of that there was a littleknown government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the american public they fucked up they tested it for  years they didnt realize these drugs were not mindcontrolling they were mindexpanding it was lsd and mescaline and shit like that and for the first time there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in by  the president of the united states was only  years old can you imagine dmx is older than that and he was gonna usher in a new era of peace he was gonna avoid the cold war he was gonna end segregation and they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in dallas this country was never the same there were seven more major assassinations in the  anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog kennedy kennedy king x evers on and on you didnt even have to be famous you could be a college student at kent state or in mississippi protesting the vietnam war and they shot them toothe  were a wild era and while all this was going on bill cosby raped  people holy shit thats a lot of rapes man this guys putting up real numbers hes like the steph curry of rape man thats a lot of rapes fiftyfour if he had raped less people thats still two dozen rapes dont forget each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it ladies and gentlemen thats over hours of rape it only takes hours to get a pilots license if rapes were aircrafts this n i g g a is top gun for sureyeah thats a tough one and i was onstage not too long ago i was in syracuse new york yeah well yeah for syracuse but the show didnt go so good all because i was talking about bill cosby a little bit not a little bit ill be honest i talked about him for like minutes and a woman stood up in the back of the room and she screamed out you are a fucking asshole for saying these things i know instantly i felt bad not bad about what i was saying i just felt bad like oh thats too bad she doesnt like the show i didnt realize it at first but not only did she say that she was rushing the stage by the time i saw her i just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode i was horrified i said oh my god im gonna kick this bitch in the face lucky for me i didnt have to security tackled her but it was a really fucking horrifying scene a scuffle ensued and then finally she screamed out to me women suffer i said i know and ladies i need you to know that i know i need you to know seriously theres a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists i would include myself in that dont ever forget we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender theres a lot of men like that in this room theres a lot of men like that in the world or as we are known on the streets bitchass n i g g a s but as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me i started to take offense and ill be honest race was involved she was a young white woman wellintentioned but just not thinking it all the way through bitch how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination she didnt get it she just kept going women suffer i know women suffer same team women suffer i know and this is when she went too far we suffer just like you slow your roll bitch you suffer yes but not like me not like us she goes suffering is suffering whats the difference i said come on white woman you know what it is you was in on the heist you just dont like your cut you suffer i suffer you suffer i suffer thats how it workscant do comparative suffering if youre hungry and your friend says you know people are starving in africa so what n i g g a i still want lunch black people know about comparative suffering and you know that its a fucking deadend game blacks and jews do that shit to each other all the time you ever played who suffered more with a jewish person its a tough game whenever you think youve got the jewish guy on the ropes that motherfucker will be like well dont forget about egypt egypt god damn n i g g a i didnt know we was going all the way back to egypt what the fuck is wrong with her what does she think does she think that i dont know that rape is wrong does she think that maybe i dont have empathy for bill cosbys alleged victims and i would be remiss if i didnt remind you that technically these are all still allegations although i admit it looks very bad perhaps if she looked at it correctly she would have empathy for me the man she was attacking a  black comedianobviously bill cosby was a hero to me and she doesnt know what it feels like to think that your hero mightve done something so heinous my god you cant imagine itd be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself had raped  people youd say to yourself oh man but i like chocolate ice cream i dont want it to rape didnt want to believe it at first i didnt believe it i said these people are obviously trying to destroy dr cosbys rich legacy even  allegations into it i was still like man he probably only raped ten or  of those people i know i know but its really toughyou guys are young imagine if you found out  years from now that kevin hart raped  people youd be like oh my god the only one that would believe that would be katt williams hed be like i knew that motherfucker was up to something i knew kevin had raped those people you know i was mad at kevin too though you know why okay first of all i didnt even know kevin was as successful as he was i found that shit out the hard way i was at home when my son busted in he said dad i need  hes only years old so i freaked out whats going on n i g g a is somebody trying to kill you he said no no kevin harts coming to town and i wanted to see his show i said how much are the tickets he said theyre  i said god damn mine are only  i said why do you need  then he goes because i want to go with you dad please and there it is so i took him to the show and we go we sit right up front the lights go down and one opening act after another goes on then kevin takes the stage the crowd goes fucking nuts thousands of people i was furious the longer the show went on the madder i got because his show was fucking outstanding it was maddening these people were fucking holding their stomachs my son was slapping his knee im like damn n i g g a i do this too kevin says good night the crowd goes crazy and then everyone starts walking to his door and the lights come on and then my son is just standing there looking at an empty stage people are pushing past me and nobodys recognizing me im like man this place fucking sucks i said come on son lets get out of here then my son looks back at me and says dad please please i have to meet him i was like oh my god so i took him backstage ive known kevin for years but can you believe i was scared to knock on his dressing room door i almost said son i havent seen him for a long time and one of kevins goons opened the door hey whats up dave chappelle what are you doing man its good to see you brother what are you doing in this area this is a terrible area im like actually i live around here listen is kevin here my son just wanted to meet him real quick i dont know cause kevins about to eat dinner just then kevin came around the corner to see who it was what oh shit whats up dave come on back i was just about to have dinner i dont know if you guys ate but youre welcome to join me if youd like and then my son pushed passed me it was some cold shit he goes actually mr hart we havent eaten in several hours man kevin took us into his back room this guy had a fucking spread it was tuesday night this motherfucker was having sunday dinner there were steaks chops corn with butter all over it my son was eating all fast embarrassing me i was like slow down son he was like then i looked over in the corner and there was a box of custommade jerseys for the local team each one was handstitched and on the back they stitched on khart on all of them kevin saw me staring at that box and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys and he walked right to my son he said hey little man i want you to have this and my son was like thanks mr hart this is when i got mad he goes if your father ever makes you mad put that on and he walked out oh that was some cold shit then i realized– i looked up what kevin made on google i couldnt believe that shit kevin is the first comedian that a drake song could be about kevin could

lets not forget ive never met bill cosby so im not defending him lets just remember that he has a valuable legacy that i cant just throw away i remember that hes the first black man to ever win an emmy in television i also remember that hes the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately i remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the super bowl every thursday night and i remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of africanamericans on his show im telling you thats no small thing ive had a television show i wouldnt have done that shit he gave tens of millions of dollars to africanamerican institutions of higher learning and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college not just the ones he raped here comes the kicker you ready heres the fact that i heard but havent confirmed i heard that when martin luther king stood on the steps of the lincoln memorial and said he had a dream he was speaking into a pa system that bill cosby paid for so you understand what im saying the point is this he rapes but he saves and he saves more than he rapes but he probably does rape thank you very much good night♪ ahah ahah ♪♪ in every ghetto ♪♪ ahah ahah ahah ♪♪ in every ghetto ♪♪ ahah ahah ahah ♪♪ in every

relationships blending cynicism and whimsy to reflect on human absurdities and truths				 in yeah yeah dylan moran offers a comedic exploration of daily absurdities the peculiarities of modern society and the complex dance of human relationships all with his characteristic blend of whimsy and cynicism from the beginning moran muses on the overwhelming and often contradictory nature of existence poking fun at everything from the relentless pace of news to the peculiarities of national identities and the ludicrousness of political discourse with a keen eye for the absurd he lampoons the societal obsession with news celebrity culture and the idiosyncrasies of various nations including his take on the british class system and the peculiar world of dinner parties moran doesnt shy away from controversial topics navigating through the complexities of politics religion and personal identity with a mix of humor and poignancy his observations on relationships—romantic familial and societal—are both bitingly funny and touchingly sincere showcasing his ability to find universal truths in the minutiae of everyday life through his performance moran holds up a mirror to the audience challenging us to laugh at our collective follies while quietly acknowledging the beauty and tragedy of the human condition  good morning blues playingaudience cheeringannouncer good evening ladies and gentlemen would you please welcome to the stage mr dylan moranhelloaudience hellohello thank you for coming all right its friday night in london and you all came thank you thank you all of the other things you could have done you could all have gone to a nandos im very touched thank you so i dont know i dont theres too much isnt there and not enough at the same time and it just carries on i cant i cant cope any more with days theres too many days days are a stupid length you know theyre just long enough to get regret and then you have to go and sleep its that feeling of ah i should have and you go arghtheres too much of everything theres too much world theres too many people theres too much news theres far too much news and it all happens too close together how are you expected to keep up with what the changes i wanted to talk about whats going on but id said enough fuck it just settle it it wont it keeps becoming something else and you know even when the you must find it hard to keep up with whats going on there was the cause it is too close together there was the royal wedding for instance which is kind of silly news you know celebrity news and then a couple of days later osama bin laden got killed this is too close together in real time its hard enough to keep track imagine whats it gonna be in  years time when you have lost your mind completelythe name osama bin laden will come up and youll go yes he was he was a very wicked man he was but he did look stunning in that dressof course his brother was the one everybody was talking about you know what an arse so its an incredible period of change and of course a lot of the focus is actually here in a great city in london and other great cities but you see it sort of close up cause this is the power hub not just of the local area the south bit the whole country and indeed the british isles this is the most powerful place in this region and so you are the decision makers and you know that and youve pretty much made up your mind about the rest of the country you know what you think about scotland and wales and ireland and the north you think theyre all hilarious and why would anybody live there you laugh at the north you think theyre all funny little short people who live in a big pie trying to sort out their relationship with the definite article throwing darts at their dinner and you know you laugh at scotland you think its full of drunken violent bestial people who are all mean and cold to the touch i live in scotland its a beautiful place yeah scotland the country where they fry the food five times to make sure its dead the country that invented baconflavoured mouthwash the country where everybody ends their stories with the same phrase it doesnt matter if youre talking to somebody whos  or  theyll tell you the same story so what did you do on saturdayoh it was really lovely you know we had a few friends around we had some lunch it was really great and we had a wee walk had a look at the loch and all that you know the mist came down it was gorgeous and then you know couple of wee glasses of wine very niceso what happened thenoh i dont know i was like thatand then you long ago decided what you think of the welsh english people are always laughing at the noble welsh peopleman hootingbeautiful people but you have decided theyre all maudlin inbred trolls liable to burst into song at any time because theyre so shortlegged and smelly thats what you think isnt it the irish you long ago dismissed as fearful drunken unpunctual unreliable and very charming charming in the sense of being incapable of running a chip van cause ireland got messed up you know were not coolheaded people like you ireland got messed up fucked really by money cause people couldnt cope with it theyd never had money people made soup and salad and risotto out of stones for hundreds of years imagine you doing that for hundreds of years then one day their menu changesand it goes stones stones stones cocaine thats what youre havingso people lost it theyre on the street going ill buy your jacket if you buy my trousers now they have nothing far too emotional to deal with money not easy you were people who had an empire threecornered hats and long scrolls and everybody walking around saying export more marmalade and import more cats where are we invading now youre still doing that youre still bombing countries that have nothing you have everything decent towel rails nipple rings probably whole shelves of them and nandos or whatever and youre bombing countries that have sand thats all they have really theres two kinds of people and two kinds of nations in the world you know theres you got your people like you coolheaded people i would call you beckers you keep everything inside you beck it and then the shakers arabs mediterranean people irish people people who have to get things out you know you keep it in look how quickly the revolution happened in the arab nations overnight the touch paper was lit popping it all went off how long would it take for a revolution to happen in this country how many times would you have to be fucked sideways by the banks for that to happen ten thousand years of people wandering round rattling their newspapers going i mean reallyanother  years of people settling their tea cups a little heavily saying im just you know i i dont knowand they a hundred thousand years before somebody stands up and says this is actually getting on my wick now you im not gonna be talking about politics for too long because its so depressing the people involved are depressing and you know what you think anyway you dont need me to argue with you about that you know where you are on the spectrum and you know what you think of the figures some people dont like mr cameron mr cameron and his cube of air he doesnt seem to know where to put that thing down anyway he cant find a place for it i think the reason he cant get rid of it is because it contains the essence of the big society and nobody wants that shit some people dont like mr clegg the token human being in a glass box whos not allowed to touch anything hey nick whats up i like music thanks nickand then some people dont care for the ferocious opposition growling what a wolverine ed miliband is hes been trying to clear not just a fur ball but an entire cat from his throat for a whole year clearing throat but you know what you think i mean you know where you are on the spectrum youre left or youre right really thats it you know and if youre left wing youre boring thats the truth nobody wants to hang around with you youre very dull youre the voice of conscience you know the one saying now look put it down we should all be nice to one another lets try and not eat everything today okay very dull voice the right wing cruel yes vicious certainly but honest not a sophisticated philosophy it just says what is this do we fuck it or eat it lets try half and half growling now you might be liberal you could be i forgot you could be you could be one of those thoughtful troublesome people people who say well things are actually a little bit like this and a little bit like that so lets do whatever you say if youre liberal you have no purpose you are the thing in your kitchen you never use something you bought once when you were out at a market feeling frisky you bought this thing you came home you put it in a drawer twice a year you take it out and you go what the fuck is this thing anyway whatre you supposed to do with this and the person you live with tells you it does nothing it goes up to eggs and it squeezes them then it leaves them alone why did you buy the fucking thing you might even be a little green personin highpitched voice the little green people people who say mind the planet be nice to the monkey and the fishes lets make our own clothes out of body fluidsnow these people everything they say is pretty much correct about the planet and the environment and so on but nobody listens to them anyway they are the vegan at the dinner table of life people who come to your house and say im hungryand you go ill try and feed them and they say im veganand you go fucker heres a torch go into the garden and see what you can find okay leave me aloneaudience applaudingthey tell you you can get everything you need from pulses and lentils and things like that yeah everything you need except company which is not to be had because you are dying bent double in a miasma of your own toxic farts so so you know where you are and people look at all the systems that failed the westminster the expenses the church in ireland collapsed and the banks banks didnt really collapse here cause the government said oh well deal with all that and they went up to the banks and they went oh you guys youre just like when you were in college close the hospitaland they and now the media its falling apart and when you got that pace of change you feel old i cant help that i feel oldnow if youre  or  youre probably not that aware anyway it doesnt really matter what government you live under if youre a young man you know you live in a sexual tyranny anyway and your penis is kim jong sex decides everything you can have a car crash you lie in the ditch thinking what is the erotic twist in the situationi cant quite seem to see it yetyeah i dont know im at that age which is i dont know what the number is but its roughly the age in a mans life when he walks into his own kitchen and his wife looks up to him and begins to tell him stories i dont know why really about other women she knows who are married to other men roughly his age who suddenly died doing something remarkably similar to whatever you happen to be doing at the time wandering around complaining there isnt enough cheese in the house its the age you when you get the idea you somehow get the idea that you suddenly deserve respect from younger people who dont even know youre there to decide whether they can respect you or not they dont know youre there cause theyre too busy with machines logged on to machines computers and phones and so on people dont know how to be alone any more or in company cause when theyre alone they fuck about with the computer and when theyre talking to you theyve got a phone and they muck around with thatyou know i said to him what are you doingim downloading the picture of a squidwhy or they talk and theyre fiddling with their phone whatre you doing what is itits an appwell what does it do what does it do whats so great about it that it justifies interrupting our conversationit measures sand from a distancewhats wrong with you what does that one doit tells you the burning point of celeryyoure fucked up you know thattheyre everywhere were living in a machine culture there are machines in the supermarket robots they blip blip this is dehumanising i miss the conversationsi enjoyed standing there talking to the lady or the man saying no i dont want a bag no i dont have a loyalty card do i look like a fucking cretin im sorry the biscuits are open i like to eat while i shop it helps me focus give me the thingswith a tin blip you cant put a machine that goes blip in a grocery shop you know you need to talk to people this country is made up of ethnicities of irish people and pakistani people and bengali people and italian people people from the caribbean people from africa people from everywhere these cultures talk you know if youre going to put robots in supermarkets at least give them an identityput irish robots in there so they dont just go blip they go ah thats a fierce lot of mangoes whatre you gonna do with them nowput italian robots in there that go in italian accent well i make you a deal on the beans you take off your top and talk to me we work things out what do you say come on herefrench robots in french accent you think im smaller than the other robots do you do you well im not you know im not i am a king german robotsin german accent have you actually got the actual money on your person can i see it please are you sure you can pay for this irish people have a very strange relationship with germany at the moment lot of respect and fear andplease please feed us no you dont give a shit youre not bailing anybody out are you youre not going to help the greeks cause this is the english mind you dont fucking youve made up your mind about the whole world you look at the greeks and you go im not helping you youre just a slightly soiled shopworn spaniard go awayyou know because this place was an empire you have to remember rule britannia remember all that britain you know did rule the waves before it became a permanently moored prison boat full of the disaffected stuttering it was quite inflated cause you were an empire you were very powerful before you became an eleventhrate nation that everybody in the world laughs atand then there was the era of cool britannia remember that you know when tony blair was around and those cool british bands a lot of manchester bands they all had that very distinctive walk youd see the manchester roll their walk was a very interesting walk it was this kind of i was looking at their walk and they all did this i was like what is that walk saying and i realised its the walk of somebody whos just got out of prison and theyve been acquitted but they know theyre guilty this was in the era of blairism you know you remember that philosophy the belief system that held that if you smiled hard enough into the face of god you would eventually shit money soone of the things thats very striking about britain is the class system and class is back people are talking about class again using these playground words chavs and toffs i found that very weird cause i wasnt aware of a class system growing up in ireland there didnt seem to be a class system not that i knew about anyway there just seemed to be everybody and then there was four people over there who had big houses but you didnt know them it seems to me british people like the class system you like to have little boxes to put people in you know you like to have aristocrats people with four sets of teeth nobody understands what theyre saying they live in big draughty houses that smell of wet spaniel and they have all the fun with their surnames cause theyre called things like mr tresoriusbletchlysarasinglepukington and so on and theres the uppermiddle class who actually have all the money and they have all the fun with their first names cause the child is christened or baptised but its never called by that name afterwards its always known by a nickname johnty ning nong biff squiff titface whatever is it go oncome on were going skiing again for no reasonwhy would anybody want to go skiing you could sit in the comfort of your own kitchen and break your knees with a hammer what is the human impulse whats wrong with these people i think its because theyre so closeted their lives are so comfortable they actually seek out danger as a pastime if youre poor you dont go and look for danger cause youre surrounded by it your accommodation is dangerous your neighbours are dangerous your own family are pretty handy you probably have a couple of moves yourself your dinner can fucking kill you anyway so you dont have to go and look for danger i mean probably the key to the english mind is the archers the radio programme now its not a programme im hugely familiar with because every time the theme music comes on i leap across the kitchen with an athleticism i dont actually possess in search of the fuck off button on the radioive caught a few phrases over the years and i gather its about some people who are very very worried about getting the crisps to the fete on time no wonder everybodys hooked is it just me or is it hot in here it is isnt it ah its always hot in the south i mean you people you live in a permanent kind of hawaiian buffet anyway dont you most of you are in a steel band thats another thing you laugh at in the north you laugh at the woman who goes out dressed on a friday or saturday night in string you think thats all very funny and you know what theres a very good reason for that its because that northern woman in newcastle or leeds or wherever has had to get through the winter and the dark a thing you know nothing about ive seen pictures of the winter down here i know thats not snow its just an over production of cream cheese you left outside you people dont know about suffering she goes out dressed like that cause of the winter and what it does to you the first  months of the winter are okay then you get a bit fucking edgy thats why she goes and buys an outfit that costs more than the rest of her wardrobe even though it only weighs a tenth of an ounce is the colour of nuclear fusion and just about covers the entry points to her body shes giving a message with this piece of clothingshes saying fuck off leave me alone i dont want to talk to you im going out i dont want to talk to you unless youre a taxi or a doorman or somebody disguised as a bacardi breezer leave me alonea perfectly sane reaction the dark creates all kinds of things the dark creates music particular kinds of music horrible folk music you dont want to listen to and heavy metal which they love in dark places they love it in scandinavia they have all these metal bands you know and theyre not like the english ones or american ones that have names like metallica and megadeth and so on the names are cause english isnt their first language in scandinavia even though they all speak it so they call their bands things like anus hammer egg smuggler all that stuff its a very interesting look heavy metal you know you have everything down here youve got jazz and ska and everything you know whatever folk music too probably folk music has its own look it has ayou know people wear dungarees cause they say im a man or a woman of the people this isnt my main thing you know im just like you really my main job is harvesting turnips anyway this next number is called crosseyed mary of the lowlands id like to dedicate it to my wifeand then theres jazz you know where you get people in suits but theyre nonconformist suits cause theyre wearing a pink shirt with a green jacket and a blue tie and trousers too complex to describe cause theyre saying yes im wearing a suit but i work for me and my job is to play the electrified tractor horn till  in the morning so fuck you heavy metal is a very interesting look the look is a kind of an argument its an argument against darwinism because what the people who are involved are saying is that attraction is not necessary for reproduction thats why they shave all the hair off where it would naturally be and cultivate it in places it shouldnt be and thats why the music is so angry you know if you shave all the hair off your arse and get into a pair of leather trousers youre gonna sing an angry song its not gonna be some wistful ballad about that crazy summer in paris with justineits going to be much more death in the morning death for breakfast little pots of toasted deathheavy metal is what happens when a group of people with competitively disgusting appearances come together to try to kill air no partly partly that is probably age speaking i just cant tolerate certain things you know its easy if youre  or  to put up with that shit but then again so much is easy when youre  or  you know you wake up you sit down you eat breakfast you walk outside you talk bollocks all day long you find somebody go to bed with them thats a wednesday if youve been on the planet for a certain period of time it gets much harder you

cope how would they they wouldnt they would be out on the street in half an hour stealing food from seagulls mouthsor worse they would cope theyd have a much nicer cleaner house and an improved sense of selfworth probably more moneyand inevitably your partner would find somebody within the first three to four days and begin a tumultuous sexual relationship they would be having sex a lot in your bed when you were dead the morning the afternoon the evening and the nighttime would be the main times they would be having sex in your bed when you were dead feeding each other lobster with their bare hands to give each other more energy to try it in new and more demanding ways when your realise you are lying besides somebody who is waiting for you to die and whats more theyre sleeping to make the time go fasteraudience applaudingyou are the lastaudience cheeringman whistlingyou are the last sensitive caring person on earth and dont fucking whifle whiffle woof dont wolf whistle me its disconcerting at my ageman whistlingokay youre probably a young person its fine if you do that you hear that you turn around might be somebody attractive at the other end if it happens to you at my age you look round and there stands death so dont fucking wolfwhistle at melisten whats im losing my thread now i never had one but i lost it anyway you know i mmm uh you know im sorry i need to i was holding something and then this um uh exercise does not have to be a big deal a lot of people use that as a kind of social competition they boast oh yeah im just going to the gym or oh yeah i just had a swim fuck you that is showing off its you can work some simple knee bends in though pretty much anywhere you know it doesnt have to be a big deal im not doing this as a thing im just because the thing is you can do it at you can do it while youre being fired you can do it anywherewhats that tim no pension oh yeah okay fuck youi might be unemployed but im supple so yeah its so hard to relax is what im saying and there people people go funny in middle age you know men go funny they get into things you know they get a hobbysay yeah ive always been interested in wood i just didnt want to say anything until now i need to go and be with my big lump of woodthey get a silly car you know a brightcoloured car that nobody else can fit inside so they can pretend they can drive around in their own penis and my thing what happened to me was i got i had this period of being addicted to action films thrillers modern thrillers really stupid ones you know the stupider the better not the oldfashioned kind of james bond one where he is in a car you know and hes got a sharp suit and a lady in a frock is there and he clicks a pen and peoples feet fall off and all that stuff not those this is the modern one where you dont know whats going on and neither does the hero thats the important thing everybody has amnesia in the film and it begins with him running across the desert picking numbers out of snakes that have been nailed to cactuses cause thats somehow going to explain who he is and what hes supposed to do and then suddenly hes on a boat and he kills  people with his insoles and then you know he finds out he can speak a dozen languages and hes an amazing pastry chef he can control condiments by thinking about them and rubbish in other words even better if its got jason statham in itaudience hootingthose films are unimprovably stupid because they begin with him being thrown out of an airplane hes got one wire attached from his heart going to his arse another one going from his brain to his bollocks and if he pulls the wrong wire he swallows his eyes and vomits his liver they are fabulous exercises in homicidal manliness and because thats what is happening to you youre becoming a blob so you outsource your masculinity you watch jason do all that stuffgo on jason break his other collarbone i got a parking ticket this morningyou see hes such a man even his lunch sweats he most men are what nerveless bags of glands you know people who jason makes decisions men most men me most men get poleaxed by indecision just walking into pret a manger not jason he pulls the whole fucking circuit board out thats how much of a man he is you see most men are ambiguous creatures you can imagine another life for yourself you could have become a library glue wholesaler in worthing you might have been a bicycle customiser in the isle ofwight you might have been somebody who repaired lighthouses in cornwall and fallen in love with the local fruit seller in midlife realized you were gay and he has been nursing a crush on you for all these years cause youd been going in and out of there buying yams and then you move to andalusia and open your own small bb with an incredible range of sherries it could happen you know but not to jason jason could never make love with another man never not unless that man contained information that could only be released through the enzymes in spam you see what im saying i can remember when homosexuality was still an issueand it still is to a degree because the anglican church is saying yes you can have gay bishops but they have to be celibatewhich kind of defies the point of having a gay bishop doesnt it whats the point of being a gay bishop unless you can say nice to be here this is my friend geoffyou know and the truth is that straight culture has a lot to learn from gay people now im talking about men im not talking about women thats just jolly japes and theaudience laughingwed all do that ifwe were girls that is the mainstream view but there is a lot of honesty in that culture that we dont have as as we i say we i mean me obviously and other straight people because you know i saw an ad in a magazine in america it was men looking for men and i was very i didnt understand all of it but i was very impressed by the honesty because it said browngreenokayhairy and versatilewhich is good there is no point being hairy unless you can turn a few tricksmainly top mainly but will do most thingsand people say romance is dead but my favourite ad on the page just said anything i will do anythingnow that is a wonderful position to be in to know you can walk up to somebodys house and say here is the box of cottage cheese here is my saxophone where is that kitten cause when we pack this baby and you hit a high c that cat has to go over the roof otherwise we dont get to eat my shoesthere is a wonderful directness about that it would be much better for straight people instead of all this gsoh i love country walks nonsensejust give it to people and say come around sit on my head and insult my furniture then well talkhomosexuality of course is not a big deal anymore i remember when it was you know its been adopted into the mainstream very much so its at the heart of the mainstream which is can only be a good thing i mean the mainstream you have to work hard to be left out of the mainstream now cause it adopts a lot people you know you live in london you see everybody who are you ernesto the sculptor from chile with the builtup shoe and a stutter come on in whats your name quinn with no upper teeth youre a performance artist you make your own cheese sometimes on purpose welcome i you know with sexual orientation if you were a man some people have a sexual crisis in their  how would you not know if you were gay as a man if youre in your  its very simple if you get to your  and you still take a small size in trousers youre a gay person all straight men are covered in excess fat all of them because they are pregnant with unused desire and resentment thats why you see them hanging around barbeques eating hamburgers they dont need saying she wont make love to me anymoremimicking eating maybe its cause youre depressing and overweightshut up you hate me as well everybody hates methere is a butterfly grill itand then men express themselves through grilling and the we should stop talking for a bit because i have to youre rubbish at talking i have to keep doing it so go away and have a bath or something or give each other some squash and ill see you shortly thank you very much byeaudience cheeringaudience applaudingman cheeringman whistlingaudience cheering okay so what did you do in the interval man  drink man  drink drinking drink yes you see yeah i know yes yes drinking mainly is what you were doing you know thats a little disappointing i made out thats what i did i cant help it thats what i do you know all the time i have to make out or ill die im like a shark in a beret i you know the thing is im the truth is look im talking to you you know were trying to relate to one another but the truth is im not like you im not like you bourgeoisie sitting there in your clothes you probably all live in houses or roofed structures thats a sign of a sellout i live on the edge im a very edgy person i walk sideways i dont have nipples its more aerodynamic i sneak up on myself and accuse myself of things later on tonight when you all are at home in bed in your flannels talking about how great i am im gonna go out and do what i do every time i hit a new town im gonna go out and buy up all the ham i can find and leave it in a lift i think you know what im saying with that cause the thing about modern art is how do you know if its any good you get a representative piece of modern art say a skull with some findus crispy pancakes stuffed into the eye sockets how do you know if you should like it or not its all about the title if its called something pretentious like the death of love thats its bad art if its called something honest like skull with pancakes thats bang on thats perfectall men like to think theyre cool oh whats that is that cake its a cake its a cake its a cake laughing evilly mmmhmm mmm this is good cake mmm the only disadvantage the only drawback to this and it is nitpicking to mention this mmm is that this stuff is great when you are a kid you know you just mmm its very good instantly you eat this as a child and you just convert it into extra miles to run when youve been around a while you eat this and you instantly convert it into extra pallbearers mmm this is very good cake ahho thank you very much whoever is responsible thank you good call the umwhat were we talking about i dont know oh yeah stuff that was it and um so you know i like to think im cool all men do all men tell themselves theyre cool you have to tell yourself this bullshit just to keep going you know i essentially think im what james dean would have become if hed survived and discovered carbohydrates and orthopedic shoes thats what i tell myself i suppose thats why i was watching those films you know and the thing is i worked out why i got addicted to them because when the bloke is running around and everyones trying to kill him and he doesnt know whats going on its a perfect metaphor for middle age thats exactly how it feels when youre walking around your own kitchen clutching a bunch of keys that youre looking foryour whole family hates youthey are shouting at you what the fuck are you doing nowshut up ive nearly cracked the code wait a minuteyou forget things you forget things names your address all that stuff the compensation is you remember things they come out of the blue because you have a past i remember things i remember some of them are not so useful i remember avocado stones with three matchsticks in the sides in a shot glass by the kitchen sink thats the thing you would do you would get a stone of an avocado and prop it up on the sticks and put it in a shot glass because then after you leave it there and after a couple of days you have nothing its an avocado stone in a glasswhat the fuck is wrong with me i should get on with my lifeand youd throw it out and you know do something useful umwell you see you know thats i remember other things i remember conversations i remember people used to have them sentences people would talk in them people would say things like oh i was very worried about seeing him but when i got there he was quick to reassure me and we actually had a lovely eveningthats  years ago roughly not  now people just go i was like ugh and he was duhthats it theres no time for anything elseaudience applaudingeventually people wont use words at all theyll just stick out their tongues and therell be little icons like you have on the phone smiley face goingand i suppose the notion of respect i mean that sounds like such an old fashion word even to say it doesnt it but you do you imagine youll get respect from younger people and even from your own children you imagine you would get respect you donti have a beautiful  daughter wonderful intelligent person i mean any parent would say that and its just true in this case i mean its not not like other peoples childrenyou know people talk to you about their children and you go ha ha ive met your children they are like a documentary from the  they are very dull people and the um anyway i said to her there is an exhibition on in town i said would you like me to take you and she said oh do we have to i said no of course not im just saying if you want to go i will take you you might like it or it might be useful to you in some way and she thought about it for a moment and then she said well i dont mind if we dont go but if we do go i dont care i had to go and lie downi have a nineyearold son every man imagines he is going to get respect from his own son its a thing you have to havei see him i light up i say hey what happened to you today how did you get on at school did you play outside what happenedhe doesnt even speak to me he just walks up to me grabs the bottom of my stomach and goes blibblibblib and walks away walks away to play angry pigeons or whatever the fuck it isi cant help whats happening to my body and its a gift as far as im concerned it makes you more empathetic with women cause you become more like themaudience dissentingdont talk to me about being a woman i know a lot more about that than you just because youre a girl dont talk about the thing i have to put up with in my new state and i am not putting up with the names for the body parts that are used that women have had to endure for a long time it is deeply insulting i will not be objectified like this i am not tolerating the word moobs they are not moobs they are mests and they are badges of wisdomoh dont get feminist on me look im not a feminist cause im a man im not qualified you know i cant be a feminist just like most women if women were serious about feminism they would have everything that feminists talked about getting equal pay you could have that tomorrow if women would give up bitching about one another for five minutes which doesnt seem to be possibleaudience whistlingaudience applaudingnot for four not for three not for two not for one you know that amazing woman aung san suu kyi the burmese dissident leader she was doing the reith lecture it had to be smuggled out of burma an amazing figure very courageous and serene and visionary person i was talking about her to a woman friend of mine and she said yeah butwhat yeah but whatwell you know her calves are kind of chunkythats the fucking problem i guess women do get dumped with childcare all the time even if they have powerful jobs it doesnt matter a woman might be a heart surgeon she still has to go clamp sponge dont play with thatbecause men they just make excusessay aw i cant i have to cause the you wouldnt understand its about numbers and stuffand they or im just too tired im not doing it im knackered from standing around generating my own saliva leave me alone im not doing itanyway i dont know how we started talking about that it was cause you had issues and now we fixed all that and the so yes i suppose men and women and you know things i dont know what to talk about lets talk about things comedians talk about i dont know what cats and dogs the difference between cats and dogs okay you know youve got cats and then dogs and they are not its different they are different but even with that stuff you cant get away from politics can you i mean you look at a dog a dog is dogs are left wing they all lick their own balls look at them they a cat does as well but reluctantly they are clearly right wing they do it but just before they do it they look at you as if to say are you busy youwhat does anyone think or believe any more belief itself is treated with disgust belief is now regarded as a kind of fat marbling the brain who here believes in organised religionman nofew audience members clapwho doesntaudience cheering loudlyyou see people in the west dont believe in anything and were proud of itwhat do you believe innothing nothing what did you have for lunch i dont fucking believe youwe dont believe in anything we treat religion with contempt faith all that rubbish what are you a child believing in this you do good and then you know you die and then you get a biscuit what are you a fucking idiot whats wrong with youwe dont believe in anything because we know about science believe in science thats the only thing we know about the atoms and quarks and things we dont understand it any of it but but thats the case so thats totally different to having a faith isnt it you know theyve mapped out  of the universe  i mean in any other job description that would be pretty poor wouldnt it have you built that wall in my gardenoh ive done you can fuck offaudience laughingthe i dont believe in god of course i dont or religion i go along with science like everybody else but i dont understand any of it so i have to rely on television programmes to explain it to me you know things like brian cox dr goodlooking a lot of women became very interested in the universe recently i noticed people will be talking and theyll go shut up the universe is on shut the fuck up its the universe very important you need to know this stuff cause he would come on and go mocking brian cox in falsetto hello um hes from one of those places look look at the nebula look isnt it beautiful its made up of millions and millions of years of things you dont understand the white light comes out of the dark matter and goes into the green lounge area its beautiful and all the women who are watching this are going it is yeah its lovely walk around some more pretty boy go on go back up the mountain i like that bit why cant you be backlit like himand he talks in metaphors which is no use to you if you dont understand the thing in the first place mocking brian cox imagine youre head is frozen sodium phapibibate and your feet are planets when you sit down you are going to see a lot of moons in your armpits what the fuck are you talking about nowanybody who has totally given up on the idea of god and the devil has never been properly kissed or flown on ryanair with a hangoveraudience cheeringyou can have god but you go to leave the devil to explain a few thingsso anyway back to pleasure the you see pleasure is difficult isnt it there was a young woman outside heathrow a couple of a while ago i was there and she was on her mobile phone and she wouldve been called a chav i dont use the word myself i dont like it very much but thats what she wouldve been called and she was a very big young woman she was fat and uh get on the spoon she i mean fat in a way that people used not to be you know you need to be of a certain age to know what im talking about time was people would be a bit fat but theyd run around skip a few dinners and theyd go back to the normal shape not this young woman this was third generation shit food fat the fat wasnt going anywhere without dynamite she looked like a sort of agm of spheres and she was talking into her mobile phone and she was saying i mean i have never ever been so drunk in my life tom kept getting me blackberry smoothies or something i had like nine pints of cider i didnt know where i was i woke up this morning and its taken me two goes of food whats a go of food is that when you take a run at it i had a mcdonalds for breakfast ive just had a burger king for dinner up until two minutes ago i was fucked now i totally related to this young woman i did were all trying to control the chariot of our appetites at all times oh she didnt care i think of what people wouldve described her as she was herself and her voice stuck in my head because at the other end of that flight the last person id spoken to was a very pretentious person who wouldve been called a toff i guess one of those english voices full of birds she was an actress and she had a lot of time on her hands because everything reminded her of something else she would say thing like oh these potatoes arent they fabulous theyre like my friend roger roger rogerson do you know him he lives in rogeronio in italy italy is wonderful too isnt it i mean its full of italians youd fuck one but you wouldnt talk to it afterwards this salad is like my girlhood its wildly overdressed and bewilderingly full of lychees i suppose the classes was probably quiet easy once you get the hang of it it seems to me its all about how much time you spend with you parents if you because the upper the higher you go the less time youre with your folks you know because around the age of one and half they come up to you and go well done you whatever your name is youre going to boarding school in argentinaaudience laughingand then if youre poor youre just with your family a lot more youre crawling out of the laundry into this bag of potatoes youre swinging off your parents cigarettes as they have sex youre there so its funny to hear people talk about all this stuff again but theyre caring about all that measuring themselves and um heres another thing that comes out of the dark right i worked this outdinner parties dinner parties must have the first dinner party must have happened in the winter cause i think what happens is women get tired of looking at the man in their house and they say lets get some other bastards round not in those words but thats what they mean lets get some other bastards round or go to some other bastards house and eat with them cause i dont fucking wanna look at you any more its depressingso its a kind of an adult womans idea of a good time its not a good time its fine if youre  or  you go out with your friends youre eating and drinking and having a good time talking thats the main event youre talking about love and life and death and work and sex and family and everything and anything that matters you dont care about the quality of the food you only know theres food there cause one of the drinks is chewyand you know you go and you you have a good time talking and then you arrive back at your house or somebody elses house you think hurray the teleporter worked again and you dont think any more about ityou get older and it becomes socially competitive because you get to somebodys house and they start talking bollocks immediately they open the front door to you and they say hi can we give you the tour no i am only here i only came out in the cold and dark because this woman that i love is sick of looking at me okay i understood this was a food gig wheres the food i have got a house full of shit myself at home i dont wanna see yoursand people sit you down and they talk about house prices and schools this seems to be the modern british persons dream to get their house into the schools so they can watch as their own children get selected for nasathey sit you beside somebody whose laugh sounds like bagpipes amazing without the bagpipes somebody on the other side whos always more interesting than you it doesnt matter what you do you might be the captain of a submarine they will be a jazz clarinetist architect neurosurgeon personand the people i didnt know people do this in their own homes they this is how competitive it is people have watched cookery programmes so they bring out starters the first time that happened to me i had a panic attack i went what the fuck is this i thought we were gonna eat this is a prawn pole dancing on a bread stick wheres the foodaudience applaudingyou cannot expect to be with people and have them relaxed if youre gonna treat them like this you got to give people decent simple fare you know heres an irish classic recipe okay its very simple you dont freak people out you feed them and you talk this is from my granny she was beautiful spiritual person she always used to say doesnt matter how big the fucker is they all have a neckyou know another thing she used to say was never get involved with more than  people sexually at one time you cannot keep everybody happy work on the farm deteriorates almost immediately dont do that andso what you do is you get a chicken okay get one use your contacts and and dont get started just cover the outside of the chicken with little things people like with twix an orange a pack of chips whatever it is and cocktail sticks you see and then you put a chocolate cake inside the chicken so people work from the outside in and then when they think its time to go you go no ha ha ha surprise and they love you the will love you for thatso i think ah who wrote frankenstein mary shelley now this is gonna sound like a bit of a generalisation all women past present and future are mary shelley and all men are the creature look at a man look at him look at a man in the morning what is he a thing banging into walls in search of a toilet he is blind and he has an erection imitating frankenstein grunting mumbling incoherently mumbling in his mind the two things are related mimicking frankenstein i have no blood in my eyes mumbles he goes to work to do a repetitive task mumbling takes a break at lunch to go for a sandwich sees something there to stir the little cosmos in his skull he sees a woman it entrains a very complex psychological effect hes about to realise something he goes he dives to his own depths to his own ocean floor and clutches at that insight breaks his own surface and this is the insight he comes up with he goes woman growls and then he goes back to work to masticate his hand patty rueing the fact that he didnt get the beef and then goes home to be told by mary shelley darling were having the jeffersons around on friday for dinner jeffersons what are they theyre our friends darling theyre guests theyre going to be our guests on friday when did we meet them you didnt meet them i met them and i liked them so theyre coming to dinner okay im just telling you because you live here you can spend the evening talking to philip youll like him why will i like philip because hes a very boring man and im not going to deal with him okay so you can have philip to yourself all night long anyway you wouldnt like samantha you just wouldnt like her why wouldnt i like samantha because shes very goodlooking and she doesnt wrap up warm enough so ill be talking to samantha you can stay in the corner all night long and make armpit farts while we have the roast potatoes roast potatoes ahh nah its thats because women are kind enough to tell you what it is you are going to be doing for the rest of your life so i mean i suppose the dinner parties are kind of the acme of middleclass life most of us are that arent we i guess we are now excuse me the cake was fine but i need to chase that up with some chocolate because im eating the chocolate and the truth is im not enjoying it um but im gonna carry on eating it because thats the way the mind works you see you tell yourself that the good chocolate is further on deeper down in the bar very much like when you wake up and you think oh this is fucking hideous ill get up things will improve so having made a lot of generalizations about women and men women women have to make themselves beautiful for men because men are the ones who go on about female beauty its men who you hear say oh i miss nancy she had such dusky insteps her knees were like porpoises heads her eyes were like lapis lazuli thrown into little dishes of utterly butterly you could hear breasts as she walked behind you she was an extraordinary woman you dont get women banging on in this manner about male beauty you dont hear women say oh i miss simon he had such beautiful balls we call ourselves a liberal democracy and theres still no platform in this society for the appreciation of scrotal beauty and the thing is woman do have to do all kinds of things themselves and they lie about it cause of all the pressure woman go and get their hair made bulletproof and get the implants the silly clothes and the stupid shoes everybody wears now you know these and they say oh i enjoy i did it for me you know i like the fact that it takes me  minutes to get in or out of a chair ive always wanted to look like a prawn whos being airlifted its a total lie thats not the kind of thing a person does for themselves you know what i did for me i had an éclair inside an éclair thats the kind of thing you do for yourself not getting fucking vajazelled getting a little chandelier hung over your uterus so because the mainstream absorbs more and more different kinds of people you know who is outside well i suppose theres extremist fundamentalist people you know and ah ive never really understood when americas reaction to osama bin ladens assassination was not very politically mature i thought because they sort of what they really as a country did was go rapping  oh yeah he dead look at him with bullets in his head  hes so dead hes dead forever and that suggested a people who hadnt really considered the idea of being bombed again um mumbles as real news that was real news not the celebrity thing i mentioned earlier the royal wedding and so on which theres an awful lot of as well you know all those magazines telling you to catch up on all that stuff the friendly overfamiliar names of the magazines hello come here give us a lick all that stuff now there are all sorts of crises happening in the world at any one time you know with food and energy and so on now im not suggesting we return to a maoist china but if you got all those people who read celebrity news and put them to work on treadmills generating electricity or whatever as long as you let them hang onto their magazines they wouldnt even noticein the context of being in the world and watching all this stuff happen i dont think it really penetrates a lot of it i dont think you care that much about it in the end whats gonna matter to you is who youre with and and whats happening between you whats happening in your own kitchen now i have a friend whos my age and single and childless and i cant begin to tell you how much i hate him because hes naive in a way that men are if they dont have children if you are a woman you dont need to have children to be empathetic if youre a man you do cause he still says to me things like so what did you get up to at easter he forgets i have a family if youve a family you dont get up to things i got in a sleeping bag but they found me so tell me all about what you got up tosingle men who give you if they have a friend who has children they give them the worst kind of presents for the children they give them those big plastic things that talk in american voices that you only ever find at  in the morning as youre crossing the landing to go for a piss you break all your toes on it and then it talks at you a is for apple i love you kiss me fuck off youre the only thing that talks to me in this fucking house but he is immature you see and what happens is that he says he falls in love all the time he says oh i met this woman shes amazing we have so much in common what do you have in common well we both like sex and champagne three days later they break up i say what was the matter oh she couldnt make bisque um this doesnt really get to the nittygritty of a relationship you knowand its difficult for people to relate to one another i mean youve to find somebody first of all and i worry about the younger generation not just because youre losing skills all the time but thats okay you dont have to worry you dont have to write or speak or spell anymore you can straddle a computer and lick it itll do everything for you but there are certain key skills you need that are being lost like dancing young people cannot dance i know this cause i got tricked into going into a disco situation yes i said the word disco from the latin meaning to put the moves on a lady under spangly lightsthey dont know what theyre doing in there anymore the music is hideous but youd expect that sort of stuff that makes your eyes foam after about three seconds but this is what they were doing this they looked like they were being tasered what happened to the popular classical dance that was established for all time in the mid  when i was growing up there was nothing wrong with those moves i did say it pronounce that in a french way but never mind moves do you like my moves the beautiful moves you know there was nothing wrong with this what intelligent woman is gonna resist that from a man look at this cleaning the ovens that was called or this judging the mice these were the greatsaudience applaudingi should go im losing itum before i do ill tell you i got a kind of a very sad letter kind of moving actually from this guy people contact me sometimes for advice im a very giving person and they can tell he said my father tells me that women are like canoes full of soup at first everybody is suspicious and then they all want one my mother maintains women are like enigma machines made of hair they might come across as fuzzy but they always know what youre thinking whos telling the truth ps where do women hang out billy  now isnt that sad i mean billy if youre out there i dont know i hate to be the one to tell you but i think the folks are giving you a bum steer there the truth is that women are like chick peas under a psychopaths hat they can be cherishable and zingy and surprising but you ask too many questions and you get killedaudience clappingthank you very much for coming everyone good nightaudience cheeringokay very quickly cause its some night of the week and youve other things to do probably so look this friend of mine that i was telling you about annoyed me actually because he he gave a woman a present and he was disappointed by her reaction i said well what was the reaction he said well you know she said oh i love this this is really great thanks very much he wanted more i mean in a mature relationship thats a fantastic reaction because usually what happens is somebody gives you a gift you open it youd look up and then theyd look at you and theyd tell you why you should like itwhats wrong with you put the fucking coat on its a fantastic coat it takes all the attention away from your face it hides you ass put the coat on its got big pockets you can keep all your selfhelp books in there i got you a new one i got you personal hygiene for the manically depressed put the fucking coat onhes in love with the state of a relationship when youre in love you go out to restaurants all the time you go to the cinema you sit there in the restaurant saying hows your fish darling is it good i wont tell you about my fish until you tell me about yours is it delicious im so pleased so is mine theyre probably

somethings wrong with my brother she came over to see me and i was they told me i was leth lethargic and she says get him in the car that aint my brother right there my little sister whos always played the background now gotta play the lead  amen  they say she drove around atlanta sorta aimlessly she didnt really know where the hospitals was but as she was drivin around she came up on piedmont hospital give it up for piedmont  whats interesting about it is that as she drove around she didnt know anything about piedmont hospital but she had a hunch that some angels is in there mmhmm cause she said thats what we gon need all right  yes hallelujah love youlove you atlanta saved your lifeatlanta saved my life  so they tell me my sister took me into the hospital and this cool white

a stroke  damn  me me man me  wow heres the thing when you dream about what you want to be in life you dont dream tragedy noyou dream everything is good i i got the life i got the cars i got all that

havin this brain bleed that led to a stroke and if i dont go in his head right now were gonna lose him   what i was told was my sister fired right back and said you can go in his head but you aint gonna find nothin  he said why you say that she said have you seen how big this nggas head is  my sister made a joke because sometimes you gotta laugh to keep from cryingto keep from cryinwhat

thats right the cool white doctor named dr schuette shot right back and said im a religious man too all right but i gotta do my job  all right so what i was told is that they take me in to operate on

whether its the mother of his child auditioning disabled actors or gun control				   ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage mr jim jefferies  hello sit down sit down sit down sit down sit down  thank you boston i appreciate that  uh thats very sweet of you  love you im at the end of the tour right now im very happy to be on tour because i now have a child ah so any time out of home is good for me um i got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months so  thank you thank you life decisions and shes a nice girl and i love her in a way sure my problem with my girlfriend is shes very sweet but shes shit at telling stories and im awesome at telling stories so it really bothers me when she talks and i dont know if thatll be a problem in the future but its a problem now and i dont see it getting better um ill give you an example right i was in the car and my son hank was asleep in the back seat and were driving along and on the radio comes madonna and my girlfriend just slips into conversation oh i used to party with madonna and i went you fucking what when and she went i used to party with madonna now i should fill you in a little bit on this my girlfriend used to be a model in miami right im not bragging i didnt get the model years i didnt get those years ive seen the photos very impressive um so i said so you used to party with madonna madonna used to have big parties and invite models over right and she went no no it would just be me and a few other people i go you need to elaborate on this story right now and she goes oh okay i used to date the center for the miami heat as soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an nba center even if this guys even slightly in proportion a lot of things flood through your head first thing is thats why your cunts so fucked up thats a big one thats why our child came out while you were walking i understand so she said i used to date the center for the miami heat his best friend was dennis rodman dennis rodman used to go out with madonna and we used to go over to madonnas house and she goes this one time the four of us were over at madonnas house and we were all fucked up on drugs and one thing led to another and then i went shut the fuck up and she went what i said i know what one thing led to another means you all started fucking each other and she went we did we started just shut up and she goes what do you care for i said youre the mother of my child i dont wanna picture you being fucked by a ″ nba player while youre licking out madonnas muscular vagina and dennis rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock going  and she goes oh youre being silly what do you care for youve partied way more than i have in my life and i went that is not true ive gotten wasted way more than you have but i have in no way partied way more than you have often i get wasted just by myself i wouldnt call it a party for most of my career i was a struggling comedian right and this is how struggling comedians party right its  am monday right were in a onebedroom apartment seven of us are standing around a coffee table trying to stretch out two grams of coke one of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories and the rest of us are talking about where women might be one of us has come up with a plan the plan goes like this well nurses will be finishing their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er theyll appreciate seven funny guys  i dont you know ive never partied like a model i have partied twice in my life twice like really partied ive had good nights out but ive really partied twice if you really party and most people never experience this its an amazing thing it happens in vegas it can only happen in vegas and its gotta involve celebrity right im not famous but the people around me were super famous and i was at this party in the night club and they took me in and then theres the night club but then theres the real night club out the back which is like the size of this stage its only a little room and you go back there and you can just they encourage you to take drugs in the open and youre just doing it off a key  and theyre going no dude use the table dont use your and i go oh oh oh sorry um and its confusing at first and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room just bring em in like huh and you can do this you can go uh like that and theyll drag these women away it is the best thing youll ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man theres a lot of remorse cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friends you go oh my god we partied so hard last night i spent  when a hot girl parties that hard she wakes up in the morning and goes oh my god we partied so hard last night i made  and thats a vastly different emotion that i dont think women will never yeah okaythis is the thing in america at the moment theyre trying to raise the minimum wage to i dont know  an hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go and still to this day women only earn  of what men earn in the workplace and of course thats disgusting how dare women earn so much like a lot of things that i say tonight will be jokes that i dont actually mean but this is something im really passionate about women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace im sorry i  im not being a misogynistic bastard right im not saying that women dont work as hard im sure they do im not saying they dont do as good a job what im saying is they dont deserve to earn as much money as men right men need that extra  to buy meals and drinks and jim jefferies tickets and all that shit  now im sure theres women in this room that are saying oh i pay for my drinks i bought my own ticket and dont think we dont appreciate the uglies cause we do right we do but theres little things in society that you cant change men have extra expenses that youll never understand theres holidays that are just for women like valentines day is just for women they say its for romantics they say its for couples or something like that its just for women theres no man who gets excited by valentines day theres no man that when he sees the valentines day decorations go up in the shopping mall he goes oh valentines day is coming valentines day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head and it goes like this how much money do i have to spend today so that you wont act like a cunt it doesnt stop there mothers day mothers day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old my girlfriends first mothers day and she went oh i wonder what ill get for mothers day and i went probably fucking nothing hes got no money hes six months old what do you think hes gonna buy you within an hour her friends were over at the house just by coincidence telling me what a bad person i was and how important mothers day is to a new mum you know and so i went and bought her a cappuccino machine cause i assumed thats what hank would have wanted her to have and i wrote a card im not a bastard i wrote a card im righthanded so i got my left hand every new dad knows this you get the crayon and you go  happy mothers day love hank and i went han and then i did the k backtofront because hes a fucking moron see now i know theres people in the room theyre thinking well fathers have fathers day fathers day is bullshit its fucking shit fathers day fathers day came around and my girlfriend went what do you want for fathers day and i went i dont want anything dont even worry about it i dont want anything and she goes come on you gotta have something i said honestly i dont want anything and she goes come on and i went its my fucking money just dont touch it just leave my money alone how hard is this how about for  hours you dont touch my fucking money that would be a gift thats why every single father has that one fathers day gift that they cherish and its shit its like a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handles too big and it says i heart dad and they keep that for  fucking years this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go that cost me nothing that mug  see wouldnt it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff but didnt cost anything that everyone could participate in right ive got it right april  anal sex day  its good isnt it everyones girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on april  its nice a month before youd be walking around the shopping center going oh the decorations are up  and its good cause if your bird didnt take it in the ass you could do the same thing that women do on valentines day when they dont get a gift you could go like oh me mate jason his wife took it in the ass twice yeah obviously theyre more connected than we are theyve uh im thinking i dont do much merchandise after my shows and stuff but im thinking of bringing out some april  tshirts not even putting jim jefferies on them or anything just tshirts that say april  cause its good right youre in a bar youre a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april  and you go fucking friends for life right but even better you see a girl with an april  tshirtthe weird thing is im biggingup anal sex here and i dont even really like fucking girls in the ass that much im not even a huge fan i much prefer the cunt i think its a much more i think that a cunt is a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex oh you know i do it i get involved cause i feel like i have to you know i but ive never been a big fan of the ass fucking i uh when i watch it on porn it seems very inviting the girls taking it so fluently in her ass and she seems to be having fun and uh but the thing is you cant smell porn you dont smell porn you just you just watch it they never and its different porn its different they clean the girls asshole they pump water into it until its very hygienic im sure and the girl seems to be so happy shes like youve got it in her pussy youre fucking her and then shes like put it in my ass shes inviting its like youre doing her a favor in porn and then shes like she says things i dont know things like im enjoying that keep putting it in my ass fuck my ass i love a cock in my ass and and the experience ive had in my own life has been vastly different ive my experience has been a lot of crying now although that can help you come at times its not what you want its not what you want for every day i like the girl who acts like shes enjoying it like you know when your girlfriends like im gonna act like i enjoy it she does that whole yeah oh no thats good  ahh ♪ im having a good time ♪ and then theyre always going are you done are you close to done you never fuck a pussy and they go are you almost done finish this like that if youre fucking ass they dont want you they want it all over quick and they do other things the porn girls i dont know how much they get paid im sure its more than what the men get paid its the opposite bit of society um but they do a thing called atm i dont know if you know what that is kids that stands for ass to mouth thats where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus and shell put it directly in her mouth and shell say something like i love the taste of my ass let me taste my ass and then the man as a favor to this woman puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work  shes been doing now i had a drunken night with my exgirlfriend where she thought shed be all wild and try that once again vastly different experience im not a big fan of the ass fucking and i dont know of any man if theyre truthful really is now theres women in the room who are thinking well why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass  what a good question  women the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because we know you fucking hate it so im a father um i love my son i love my son the same way that i love cigarettes i like to hold him for five minutes every hour and the rest of the time im thinking about how hes fucking killing me hes a good little boy no hes a great little fella i really like him um my girlfriend super loves him though its fucking creepy and im glad i have a son that worked out good for me i wouldnt be a good father to a girl it wouldnt be good for me nothing weird wouldnt fuck it i i just dont get along with women you know how it is i dont want them in my house and so because you dream see for example okay when hank was born the couple over the road within two weeks of hank being born had a baby girl and rightly or wrongly the first thing that went through my head was aw thats great i hope hank fucks that one day thats what i think cause thats what i think about my son i hope when hes of age he just fucks everything i dont care if my son is gay or straight all i care about is when he is of age that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires that is my dream for my son  but never in the history of fathers and daughters has a father held his baby girl and gone oh i hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life i hope youre never shy of a cock i hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up right you know and its not just me women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well my girlfriend goes to the gym every morning i go there very occasionally and when you go to the gym theres a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off and inside that daycare theres like three women in their  theyre very nice ladies and you hand your kid off and he plays then when you finish your workout you come and get him and theres a woman that works there who just loves my son she sees all the other kids but she loves hank and hank fucking loves her and the two of them light up when they see each other and its super cute i bring hank up the stairs and he starts going uh uh trying to reach at her all right and she does this she goes everyone my boyfriends here heres my boyfriend give him here hes my boyfriend and then she kisses him and she goes ♪ my boyfriend gives me kisses my boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ its fucking adorable but i tried doing that with a baby girl lets say you go to the gym and theres a daycare and me and a couple of my mates are working there hey everyone me girlfriends here give her here give her here shes my girlfriend my girlfriend gives me kisses you know that right shes always giving me kisses enjoy your workout dont worry about a thing   so also its just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter its just little things even when theyre babies its just easier theres a wiping technique when youre wiping a babys ass i dont know if you have children but this is how you do it the baby lays on its back you put their feet together you lift the feet up and then you go in and wipe with a boy you can wipe like that up and down side to side whatever the fuck you want right with a girl you gotta wipe downward and away downward and away its very important that you wipe away from the cunt very important cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts they do they fucking hate it boys dont give a shit fucking my son will have shit all over his dick and balls and ill be cleaning it off under the foreskin and hell be laughing like its the best day ever even at my age now i find it funny if i have shit on my dick if i fuck my girlfriend in the ass i pull out ive got shit on my dick ill ring me mate jason up and go hey jason its happened again i got shit on my dick and hell tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick and well laugh and laugh and laugh but never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and shes thought oh i cant wait to call karen   when you when my girlfriend got pregnant when you meet when you havent got a child couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children whenever you meet couples with children theyre always like it is the most fulfilling thing ive ever done with my life my heart grows larger and larger every day and then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant those same people went like this youre never gonna sleep again  forget about it its over youre not gonna sleep theyre constantly telling you youre not gonna sleep raising a baby is not that hard ill tell you what its easier than a coke habit i had a coke habit for sevenandahalf fucking years at least its not me who wakes up crying anymore i can sleep through other people crying ive had girlfriends thats like white noise to me i find it soothing see me and my girlfriend just two months we went fuck it lets have a kid fucking did it right these other people man you know these couples and they date from high school and then they go out for a bit longer and then after being together for like seven years they go were getting engaged you wanna come to the party and you wanna say no youre really boring and we hate you but you go oh okay great youre still together are you you fucked one person have you oh how exciting and and then what they do is they dont have a kid right away because theyre still not ready we have to see how our careers are going and shit and what they do is they get a dog and then they act like the fucking dogs their baby they refer to it as their fucking baby they send you a christmas card of them holding the dog and it says from our family to yours and then you have a barbecue and you invite them the humans right then they come over this fucking dog runs in jumping over everything and youre like what the fuck is this shit and theyre like we had to bring him we bring our baby everywhere and you go well your baby is biting my actual baby can you control and then eventually they decide theyre gonna have a kid cause theyve learned so much from the dog and then they bring the kid back and the dog runs up like whats happening a new person and theyre like fuck off we dont love you anymore were going and they think theyve learnt something from the dog and they havent learnt anything what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the dog dies you go off you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog try to pass it off as the same dog what happens if your girlfriends away on work and the baby dies very hard to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easier if youre black or asian  boston no no no shut up i will not put up with racism at my shows okay im not saying cause they look the same im saying cause theyre easier to purchase   if angelina jolie and madonna have taught us anything it is that you can buy black and asian people im yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child going yolanda quick get hans bring him over come on im gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit uh gun control now no wait before you dont get excited because the other people have guns the antigun people are like yeah do it jim no lets just  now before i start saying this i wanna say this right i believe in your right as americans to have guns im not trying to stop you from having guns all im saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the oh it doesnt matter i dont like guns right im gonna say some things that are just facts right in australia we had guns right right up until  in  australia had the biggest massacre on earth it still hasnt been beaten and now after that they banned the guns now in the  years before port arthur there was  massacres since the gun ban in  there hasnt been a single massacre since i dont know how or why this happened uh maybe it was a coincidence right now please understand that i understand that australia and america are two vastly different cultures with different people right i get it in australia we had the biggest massacre on earth and the australian government went thats it no more guns and we all went yeah all right then that seems fair enough really now in america you had the sandy hook massacre where little tiny children died and your government went maybe well get rid of the big guns and  of you went fuck you dont take my guns  so heres where it gets confusing right now as i said i am all for your second amendment rights i think you should be able to have guns its in your constitution what i am not for is bullshit arguments and lies there is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun and this is the argument fuck off i like guns its not the best argument but its all youve got and theres nothing wrong with it theres nothing wrong with saying i like something dont take it away from me but dont give me this other bullshit the main one is  i need it for protection i need to protect me i need to protect my family really is that why theyre called assault rifles is it ive never heard of these fucking protection rifles you speak of protection what the fuck are you talking about you have a gun in your house youre  more likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think well thatd never happen to me you dont know that because you know what♪ from time to time we all get sad ♪ ♪ one day youre happy then youre sad ♪ ♪ and then uhoh ♪protection i had a breakin in manchester england where i was tied up i had my head cut they threatened to rape my girlfriend they came through the window with a machete and a hammer and americans always go  well imagine if you had a gun and im like all right i was naked at the time i wasnt wearing my holster i wasnt staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through what world do you live in where youre constantly fucking ready you have guns cause you like guns thats why you go to gun conventions thats why you read gun magazines none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security conventions none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door going fucking yeah like youre going to be ready if someone comes into your house you have it at all fucking times by the way most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking tv you think that people are coming to murder your family how many fucking enemies do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyones coming to murder you see if you have it readily available it becomes unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kids picks it up thinks its a toy shoots another one of your kids happens every fucking day but people go thatd never happen in my house cause im a responsible gun owner i keep my guns locked in a safe then theyre no fucking protection someone comes into the house youre like wait there fuckface oh youve come to the wrong house here buddy boy i tell you what im gonna fuck you up okay is it  to the left or  to the right your mothers birthday why the fuck would i know your fucking mothers birthday maybe if you didnt leave the window open  because its too hot in here we wouldnt be getting fucking murdered right i find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer is more guns after sandy hook happened the nra said and i quote none of this would have happened if the teachers had guns i i think theyre forgetting what school was like does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to whenever she came into school that relief teacher came you and your friends would see her and go  oh were gonna make her cry and then shed stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking and youd go youre never getting married are you miss never gonna happen for you then shed get back to her  volkswagen beetle and shed be crying over the steering wheel just why dont they like me lets give that cunt a gun and see how things work out  and then they go oh well answer to that well just add more guns they go well put an armed security guard at every school across america yeah thatll work out the average security guard in america earns  an hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero someone comes onto the school and  and youve got kevin now im sure kevins shithot at call of duty but it might not fucking cut it ladies and gentlemen now i understand that when im doing this joke in this room  of you agree with me  of you dont agree with me and i do respect the people who dont agree with me dont think i dont out of the  that dont agree with me  of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and its not to be taken seriously and theyre laughing along cause its just funny jokes right and then the next  have sort of phased out a little bit theyre looking around going wonder how they got that chandelier up there and then theres the last  and theyre fucking furious right now in this room and the people watching at home  of you are fucking seething just and for a couple of reasons first reason im making good points  second reason second reason second reason and this is the big one im foreign and thats pissing the fuck out of you right now and your brain is on a loop and you cant fucking turn it off and its just going around in a circle and youre just going if you dont like it go home if you dont like it go home and my answer to that is no i came here legally i pay my taxes ill say whatever the fuck i want your first amendment means that i can say the second amendment sucks dicks and unless youre an american indian youre a fucking immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it i understand that to americans your constitution is very important i respect it but please understand that every country has one as well its no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia i dont know what it says ive never seen it if theres a problem well check it but everythings going fine and dont get me wrong i get that the constitution is important to you i have had fucking i get it right ive had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as im leaving the theater going  you cannot change the second amendment and im like yes you can its called an amendment if you cant change something thats called an amendment see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you dont know what a thesaurus is get a dictionary and work your way forward dont think your constitution is set in stone youve changed things before you used to have prohibition in there right and then people were like hey who likes getting fucked up yeah i like getting fucked up too lets get that one out lets get that one out you used to have this other thing in america called uh slavery and then lincoln came along and went thats it no more slaves and  of you went fuck you dont take my slaves and the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns why should i have my slaves taken off me im a responsible slave owner im trained in how to use my slaves safely just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesnt mean that my rights should be taken away from me i i use my slaves to protect my family i keep my slaves locked in a safe thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me ive done nothing wrong look i agree with you if youre a responsible gun owner and you dont fuck around with them then you should be allowed your guns you really should but thats not how society works we have to play to the  that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us we have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving right i take drugs like a fucking champion right  we should all be allowed to take fucking drugs but we cant can we because sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids oh oh thanks sarah you fucked it up for everyone right everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we cant because jonathan got drunk and ran over a family thanks jonathan now i have to drive at  you fucking idiot see thats the thing why should i have my guns taken off me im responsible just because that guys crazy whos to say youre not crazy thats the thing about crazy people they dont know theyre crazy thats what makes them crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth is i think therefore i am you know that you exist anything past that is open to interpretation right you know you exist and thats it right now i think im in boston talking to  people thats what i think im doing but there is a good to fair chance that im in a mental home standing in front of a white wall going  i hate guns i hate guns i hate guns  see one of the better arguments is well if you take the guns away then only the criminals will have guns not true when they banned the guns in australia it worked when they banned them in britain it worked okay the bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in sandy hook costs like  american and you can buy it in walmart itll be delivered to your house thats it man  bucks right that same gun in australia on the black market costs  now if you have  you dont need to be a criminal youve got  youre a great little saver keep going so that covers the criminals but that doesnt cover the people who wanna murder your family that are coming after you and your family it kind of does the people who do the massacres it covers them cause they go the kid at colorado who thought he was the joker lets say that he had some social issues the kid at sandy hook was aspergers as fuck right i dont know if you know a lot about the black market but you cant just rock up at the docks going  guns who wants to sell me a gun now im gonna wrap this up we wont talk about it anymore now see the one thing that i do really agree with with the right to bear arms i really agree with that the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government became a bunch of cunts you could all get your guns and fight back and thats why it was written –  – yeah and that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets but you do know the government has drones right you get that youre bringing guns to a drone fight if we went back to muskets im all for it keep the second amendment if we all have muskets muskets are awesome every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times you know whats good about the musket it gives you a lot of time to calm down someone calls your wife fat and youre like fuck you buddy ah youre not a bad guy youre all rightnow after the show were gonna go out have a big party around boston see how it goes im not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore my girlfriend has said thats a no cause i dont behave myself in there so im not allowed to go to them anymore cause strip clubs arent what women think they are  it used to be like okay so when a man goes to a strip club its all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible thats what men want to see women when they go to their magic mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are women wanna see a guy hey ladies hes a fireman and he comes out with his hose and like that and whenever a stripper takes their clothes off theyve still got the firemans hat on or a tool belt on or policemans gun on a holster right because even when a mans naked a woman wants to know that he has a job when men watch strippers we want them to have a job and that jobs stripping we want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money and just go you cant take care of your kids its and when men get private dances in these strip clubs i dont know i dont know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms but basically its dry humping theres no dancing the girl gets in front she gets where your cock is pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face and you go thats what a private dance is right i dont know if theres private dancing in female strip clubs  i cant imagine that there would be i dont imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going she goes how was it and she goes well he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead i got to go to the atmso legit got canceled  yeah i know i know it who wouldve thought it wouldve struggled on that great fxx channel that everyone knew about the first season is on netflix this special is being recorded for netflix so you can go watch it there if youre watching the special it was im very proud of it we had two great seasons of really good television and if people didnt now the whole tv show is based around one standup routine that i used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that i took to a brothel which is a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who in the end we used dj qualls and dj qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip hes the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle  flow and hes the white guy out of the movie hustle  flow now the great thing about dj is he already looks disabled he has that latter stages of aids thing going on its great for casting anyway but i didnt want dj to begin with i wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actors union of america said you cannot do that because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy i think are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired and i said all right what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer and they sent me a list and on this list i said can you get rid of all the contagious ones and what have we got left so i saw every disabled actor in hollywood and ill be honest with you not that many of them i dont know why maybe theyre just lazy they dont wanna work maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly and none of them were very good either everyone we saw none of them were very good cause acting is all about what you do with your hands none of them knew what to do with their hands and they all came in until this one guy came in i had seen a lot of people that day this guy was the most disabled person id ever seen in my life he was like think of the most disabled person youve seen then double it really super disabled he was shaped like a pretzel he was being carried in by this big russian nurse carried him in he made that great disabled sound of  that one i just loved him anyway so he comes in for the audition and im sitting there and were doing the lines together and at first i didnt know if he was mentally all there either so i was being a little bit patronizing i was going thank you so much for coming in and then we did the dialog together and i didnt have to worry about a thing this kid was funny he was smart his timing was impeccable i thought he was just great and i helped him out of the room and i come back to the director and i said thats our guy thats who we gotta pick and he agreed but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheels himself in now obviously hes just a paraplegic if hes wheeling himself in which means the waist down and that didnt really suit me because paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but i thought if hes a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role so he comes in he comes in i shake his hand and his leg slightly comes out at the same time and i went whoa whats going on there kicky and he goes oh you got me im not disabled and i said youre fucking what now and he goes im not disabled i just really wanted the role so i rented a wheelchair and i said just shut up so let me this is how your day has mappedout thus far you woke up this morning you drove to the wheelchair rental place you rented a wheelchair you carried it out i assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drove here you got the wheelchair out you carried it up three flights of stairs you went to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sat in it and practiced your lines and he went yeah and i said youre a fucking asshole mate get the fuck out of here and i kicked him out and later on that day im sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors im gonna call to tell them theyve got parts and im holding this disabled guys headshot and i just think im gonna call this guy up im gonna change his life this is an awesome moment right and im looking at it and he looks super handsome in his headshot he looked really like and i thought this has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history the shutter on his camera has gotta be like  like  and then i read the guys biography and then it dawned on me this guys not disabled either i hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair this cunt rented a nurse do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse im all for a method actor get into character three hours before but once you finish the audition stand up and go tada and we would have gone that was very good but ill tell you what you dont do dont make me carry you to your car i carried him down three flights of stairs going you did very good hes like thank you jim  i was uh i go to a therapist cause i get depressed so i got a therapist every now and again i literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like im gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind like just out of the movies right and she went red and i went blue and then she went cooking and i went food and all that type of stuff we went like this forever and then she went for the last question she went and whats your favorite thing in the world and i went coming on a girls face now now i couldve said things like ice cream is a good answer hank wouldve been an excellent answer but i said coming on a girls face and ive had six months to think about my answer and i stand by it – i –  im not proud of it i hate myself for thinking it its such a horrible thing to do to another human when a girls on her knees and you its so and as an atheist i believe in darwin and all the things that he wrote but he never had a bit where he explained that there was never a bit in his book where he went when a caveman loves a cavewoman hell ejaculate on her face so that flies wont come near there was never that never that moment but by golly if its not fun i find it to look to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time may i say bravo dont dont think what you do has gone unnoticed we notice we appreciate your work i think you deserve a parade of some kind during memorial day after the vietnam vets before the first gulf war guys we could bring in and heres the women who take a load on their face and you could march out and married men would stand there going god bless you ladies  i enjoy your acting that you do the standard tongue out and the like that i dont know why but i enjoy i know its a lie i know youre not excited but i still appreciate the effort is what i enjoy i love the look because its such a oh jeez im excited too when this come hits my face theres a good chance ill also orgasm anything could happen in this crazy world but this is what redeems us as men this is what redeems us just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face our bodies flood with remorse the next  seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you  i go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on earth im like you fucking slut oh i love you ah uh all right no no no put your tongue back in um keep your eyes shut just keep them shut uh all right im going to get a towel ill get a towel ill get you a towel all right youre a wonderful mother to our child   see this is what kills me my son will one day watch this dvd and im the guy whos meant to teach him right from wrong and im there wiping come off his mothers facei think i did something illegal with my son the other day i think it might be illegal tell me if this is illegal all right im in the shower my girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning and when she came back i was in the shower and hank ran up and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like argh like that and i went  and i saw his little face and i went hello hankie and then in the condensation i drew a little bowtie on him and a little suit and then i gave him a voice bubble that said i love my daddy love hank but i did it so i could read it well of course he could read the k and then i stepped out i stepped out of the bathroom and i went gday hankie and he slapped my cock and he ran off now is that illegal i dont know is it illegal because a a child touched my cock or because b i found it really funny and ive been telling everyone and i cant get angry at him because his whole life hes been lying on mats with things dangling over hes been training for this his entire lifei think ive uh i think ive become american more american than i am australian lately and there was a moment where i tipped over where i went oh i think like an american person now and im happy to do it i just ill tell you what happened i was flying around i was doing a tour of australia and i was flying domestically around australia and im so used to airports and stuff here in america that okay what happens is when you go i was flying sydney to melbourne when you fly domestically in australia you go up to the machine put your name in prints your ticket out it prints your bag thing you put the bag thing on your bag yourself and then theres a conveyor belt underneath you throw your bag on bag fucks off you dont speak to anyone then i go up to the gate bit and the ladys going tickets please and im holding my id out like a fucking simpleton cause i get through airports quick man im like fucking there you go and she went put your id away i dont need to see that and i went i think you do and she went i dont why would i need to see your id and i said i might be a terrorist and she went would showing me your id stop you from blowing the plane up no id probably still blow the plane up so then i get up to the tsa conveyor belt thing and im so good at the airports im already taking my shoes off as im walking right and all the australians behind me assume that im american and theyre losing their fucking shit theyre like oh for fucks sake one of these cunts eh and the tsa guy goes hey mate what are you taking your shoes off for and i went  i dont know maybe theyre bombs and he went but theyre not are they i put me shoes back on i get my laptop out everyones going mental and the tsa guy says very politely but extraordinarily sarcastically he goes jeez mate thats a nice computer why are you showing it to everyone it might also be a bomb and then the guy said the most australian thing ive ever heard come out of anyones mouth ever he went oh come on mate you wouldnt have two bombs   im not even quite sure what that means but it does make some type of senseall right oscar pistorius if you havent been following the case youre missing out this is the greatest thing since oj simpson youre fucking missing out mate if you dont know who oscar pistorius is let me fill you in oscar pistorius is a legless man from south africa known as the blade runner he ran in two olympics the disabled and the ablebodied olympics in one year no one has ever done that hes an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and ablebodied people alike and on valentines day last year he shot and killed the hottest girl on earth and thats when he became an inspiration to me cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there you cant just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want  people have feelings you cunts now theres a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day one of the theories is that they found in her phone he went through her phone and on her phone he found some text messages from a south african rugby player on valentines day right now i dont know if youve ever been to south africa but in south africa rugby is more popular than legless running it goes rugby legless running cricket legless runnings their second sport you wouldnt have thought that anyway im going to reenact what i believe happened that day to do that i will now be doing a south african accent now i know many of you cant tell the difference between my accent and a south african accent heres the difference picture my accent but im punching a black person what im trying to say is south africans are horrible people so shes coming out of the shower shes been drying her hair shes listening to rodriguez or something she comes out hes laying on the bed he looks up at her hes holding the phone and he goes  what the fuck is this ive been through your phone you have been texting a rugby player and shes like oh fuck you who the fuck do you think you are who am i im oscar pistorius the greatest legless runner that has ever been thats who the fuck i am well i would rather be with a rugby player at least he is a whole man not a threequarter man like you –  – i know  oh fuck you no fuck you im leaving you and then she storms out of the room and then he was like you fucking bitch  i hate you  you will rue the day that you left oscar pistorius the blade runner dont go anywhere  i hate you thats where he keeps his legs all right then he put the blades on oh youre in trouble missy i tell you i go to my gun safe she locked herself in the bathroom he shot her through the bathroom door seems like overkill doesnt it bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them but oscars one of the few men on earth that couldnt kick the door in right he was wearing the blades so boing ah so i think oscar will probably go to prison now in south africa one in four people have aids i assume it may even be worse in the prison population now can i say this look ive never raped a man i hate that i have to put a man in that sentence but whatever ive never raped a man but if i was going to rape a man it would be a legless olympian cause in prison its all about getting one up on other people and making people think youre tough and all that like you want to fucking rape me i just raped an olympian bitch is that what you fucking want thered be a wonderful moment when youre in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a terminator movie  you know what i like about that joke so often when you tell a joke the rapist is the villain in the story but not in that one not in that one hes the heroall right we have to get going soon before i leave – i thank you very much for coming –  no i said soon not over its just soon you cunts so calm down   i always i always find that weird when someone like whistles like that what do they think is going to happen like im going to go fucking you know me mate i was enjoying claps and cheers but what i needed was a highpitched squeal noise thank god you came along to pick up my spirits  love you all right final story now i was in south africa again jeez i dont think ill be working in south africa after this special comes out i used to do like one tour in south africa every year and i just dont know if ill be invited this time theyll be like  we dont like him hes no good anyway so im in south africa and i had to fly back from cape town to los angeles which is like a  flight youve to go up to london and go across cunt of a trip um but it was all right cause i had a business class ticket so i didnt give a fuck and when i travel economy i try to dress up nice cause i like to look good in case someone recognizes me and i might get an upgrade but when ive already got a business class ticket i try to look like a bag of shit cause its important to me that everyone else in business class doesnt want me there and theyre annoyed by my presence so im wearing a white tshirt thats got brown stains on it with a hole in the side im wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out so anyway i go up to the counter up to the business thing with the thing and i go hello and the lady goes  oh mr jefferies im so sorry but you have been downgraded i said you what now she goes business class is full you have been downgraded and i said i understand that business class is full i bought one of the tickets that made it full and she went im sorry sir theres nothing i can do and then i just went are you fucking kidding me now you know when youre dealing with customer service people and they want you to swear cause as soon as you swear they dont have to engage with you anymore they can act like theyre the first adult never to hear a swear word and they can get really offended right so i went are you fucking kidding me and she went please do not speak to me that way i have done nothing wrong and i said are you a white south african telling me youve done nothing wrong anyway tensions rose the manager comes over big fat cunt called simon fulcher right he walks over and goes  what is wrong here what is wrong and i said i bought a business class ticket and i want a business class ticket and he goes what do you want me to do make a new chair for you there are no more seats i cant do anything he goes ill tell you what i can do go up to the executive lounge have some peanuts enjoy a beverage listen to rodriguez and if something opens up we will move you back up to business class so i thought theres nothing i can do so i walk off with my ticket im walking through the airport like fucking british airways bunch of fucking cunts right i get up to the counter and the woman behind the counter said tickets please and i hand over my ticket and she goes  im sorry sir but this is for business class passengers only your ticket says economy on it and i said  i bought a business class ticket but you people have downgraded and as i was doing my little speech she looked past me and went next  listen here you fucking cunt  all right now you say cunt in any foreign country people lose their fucking shit security came from everywhere i was going dont you fucking come near me cunt and i said i want to speak to simon fulcher like im and they go all right they ring the manager up and then they go he goes is it the pale australian man and the guy went yes he goes weve had problems with him let him through right so i go through im sitting there im eating my peanuts and im just angry now going fucking british airways fucking cunts fucking like that and in walks in a group of americans about  of them you know the type right they all and whenever i see americans abroad ill do my impersonation of any american abroad when americans are abroad youre just pointing out shit you see youre just walking around going  oh this is great look at that thats a chair right there okay oh whats that over there okay wonderful great right and this group walked in and one of the women in the group went like this she went  did anyone else see that australian guy speaking to that lady out there some people have no class and i put my head around the pylon and i went you can fuck off and all you dont know what ive been through ive been downgraded and as i said that  other people who were given the same lie that i was given that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class the penny dropped none of us are getting promoted they all lied to us and we formed an angry militia in seconds it was like a scene out of braveheart and they all stood up and went fucking downgraded and the woman in the group was doing this dont speak to me that way who the hell do you think you are and all the men in the group were like hey why dont you shut the fuck up just shut the fuck up ♪ it doesnt matter these people seem very angry so ♪ and a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down and sometimes americans sometimes you can seem a little insincere and he came up and he went  hey hey yeah i get it  downgraded yeah that really grinds my gears i tell you that yeah i would write a stronglyworded letter i really would and then i thought at least this guys being nice and i said look mate dont worry about it its not like its your fault and i said why are you in such a big group anyway and he goes oh were in neil diamonds band thats neil diamonds backup singer you just called a cunt there and as he said that neil diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero and i reacted like he was one i went neil diamond and neil diamond went  hey whats going on and then for a second there there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe neil diamond could solve problems and i went neil me and all these people weve been downgraded and neil went oh oh right uh well maybe thats our fault we decided to come back a day early you can fuck off and all neil diamond and then a fight breaks out amongst the neil diamond band and the downgraded punches are thrown not by me i dont know if you have the internet but im not much of a fighter im an excellent scurrierawayer i get down hey what have you got there hiya anyway the airport police came three people were arrested from the downgraded but three people were arrested from the neil diamond band and that meant that three seats opened up in business class  ladies and gentlemen thank you very much good night

coming i appreciate it god damn put your phone down fckface i see you btch put your phone down motherfckers they cant use their eyes everybodys gotta live through their goddamn phone whoo im high as fck whoo its strange i wasnt sure if i was gonna do this sober im like ugh its not the move not in san francisco this is i love pot but the people that are making edibles need to slow the fck down oh my god what are you trying to do to peoplei had a pot gummy bear the other day i think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldnt be able to steal your soul right how the fck are these people making these things man theyre not consistent thats also part of the problem you dont know what youre getting cause theyre not making them the same place where they make tylenol nah its some greasy dude with a grateful dead tshirt on and a gray ponytail hes got a bowl of ingredients and he cant remember whether or not he put weed in yet this dudes time traveling just back and forth he just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings you eat it and its not what youre looking for its not regulated you gotta ask questions i asked a dude at the pot store i go hey man how strong are the gummy bears he goes thats not a unit of measurement hes like el diablo el diablo fck man how much should i take just the leg just the leg why are you selling whole bears what the fck are you trying to prove man they just watch you leave with that bear they go oh shit they know they know youre not gonna die youre gonna think youre gonna die but everybody lives learn some shitwe learn some shit from the scary trips see the thing about edibles one of the problems with it being illegal is that a lot of us dont have a lot of information that we could use like theres a difference between smoking it and eating it when you smoke it you get thc but when you eat it its processed by your liver and it produces something called  metabolite thats five times more psychoactive than thc and it lets you talk to dolphinsthis is a real moment that changed my life i was in hawaii and we were on a boat and we were fishing we were pulling these lines behind the boat and i was so high i was trying to figure out which way the earth was spinning like the boats going this way and the suns up there im like um for like  minutes im paralyzed so while this is all happening these dolphins just show up and if youve ever been around wild dolphins theyre very trippy its very different than you expect because they look at you they like check you out they like pop out of the water and they like look at you like a person not like a fcking deer or woodchuck they look at you like another person granted i was so high i thought i was gonna die but im making eye contact with these dolphins and i started thinking how smart are these fcking things because were fishing dolphins eat fish but you never catch dolphins ever no one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin and all i could think of while these dolphins were like hopping through the water and looking at us and shit i was thinking if people lived in the water youd fcking catch em all day they wouldnt even have to live in the water if cheeseburgers just floated down geary street at least once a week a guy would be like im taking a chance and you see em getting yanked up to the clouds fck we lost billy the bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloudyou dont catch dolphins on fishhooks man thats weird theyre around fishing all the time and like btch theyre fcking smart how smart well i watched a dolphin documentary and it said they have a cerebral cortex thats  larger than a human beings i dont know what that means but if you say it right and dont fck up the words it makes you sound smarter than you really are i think what it means is they have big fcking brains but we dont think of them as being smart cause they dont do what we do right they dont send emails they dont have houses but if you lived in their world you dont need anything you dont need your fingers no ones typing they have a language thats so complex we cant understand it all the foods free they stay where the waters warm i started thinking how fcking smart are they what if theyre exactly the same as us what if its just some different branch of evolution we went one way they went the other what if consciousness is the same i was thinking what if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin the way you think of yourself when you say the word me i was like what if thats exactly how a dolphin feels theyre just living life through different biology different genetics different life experiences but if i lived a dolphins life i would be him and if he lived my life he would be me and then i started thinking what if thats the case with people what if everyone is exactly the same were just living life through different bodies what if thats the secret of happiness treat everyone as if its you living another lifei mean and then i thought god damn how good is this weed im getting in california whoo im on a fcking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean talking to water people the problem with treating everybody as if its you living another life is you wanna fcking smack yourself half the people you meet you just wanna fcking smack emwe live in the weirdest time ever i mean its the most awesome time ever but its the weirdest time ever too were like that close to president trump no boono boo you boo but you wont vote you fcks all those bernie sanders people yo bernies the shit did you vote for him voting aint real bro it doesnt even work dude we are that close to president trump bill cosbys a rapist and bruce jenners a chick were in an episode of lost down is up and up is down this is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games this is the world we get we get a goddamn nerfedup world filled with nonsensenobody wants to be president nobody i hope hillary wins that way we can realize chicks cant do that fcking job either its a stupid job its a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers its dumb its just some oldschool shit that we need to get rid of it doesnt make any sense being president is great if theres like  people if theres  people you can figure out which ones the best three hundred million people i have three kids i dont know where the fck they are right now how is this one dude in charge of  million people its nonsense its so old and stupid they make this guy sleep in this fcking white house if trump wins you know his house is cooler than the white house hes like im not sleeping in that shittyass stupid house trumps probably got like a tube at home that he opens up and a chinese girl just pops out of it and sucks his dick and goes right back in thats what i would do if i had that kind of money were down to assholes wheres elon musk when you need him wheres the fcking geniuses wheres mark cuban no we got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the  we got an old man who hates money and we got a reality tv star with a plastic set of hair you cant have a president with environmental concerns when every time this motherfcker does his hair we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames hes got like a closet full of aqua net at home you cant pretend you dont give a fck when you have that thing going on dude stop thatthe white house got broken into while obama was in office the first time in over  years that someone broke into the white house also the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself what are you trying to say that women cant do everything men can do exactly thats exactly what im saying that seems sexist right people say youre sexist no its not sexist heres why its not sexist cause men cant even do everything men can do see theres no physical equality folks thats why we have the olympics cause theres people that can do some shit that you and i cant do one of those things is guarding the fcking white house i know i cant guard the white house you know how i know because ive met shaquille oneal and his dick is where my face is thats not equality thats not white privilege listen if the white house is experiencing a shaq attack im the wrong dude to save the world i did fear factor with shaq if were holding hands itd be like a sixyearold at the park with his dad were barely the same thing so do i think women should guard the white house no i dont think i should either its not sexist to say that women cant do big physical labor things as good as giant men can but people will tell you it iswell im not sexist as a matter of fact my favorite people are all female i have a wife and i have three daughters theyre my favorite people in the world but i could beat the fck out of all of them okay listen if theyre guarding the door im getting in i dont mean to sound cocky but im just real confident i could fck them up if i had the flu okay yeah were different were different i could beat up my cat too im not proud of it i just tell you whats up if you wanna bet money bet money on me ill fck that cat up most likely cats are fcking weird like that man i was petting my cat once and he bit me i was like whoa are we gonna do this what the fck are you doing here i got a little nervous got a little nervous women can do everything men can do this guys a piece of shit were leaving too much information is going in that i dont agree with what the guy said was total bullshit total bullshithowd that girl get that job ill tell you how that girl got that job because someone let her have that job which means either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her or her boss was a chick and she hated her either ones possible look if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to fck her that makes total sense if theres one hot girl and shes working with five guys in an office no works getting done in that office that office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to fck her each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole theres gotta be a fcking way theres gotta be a fcking way you got this girl whos like i could guard the front door oh you could definitely guard the door no doubt no doubt and over time if this woman doesnt sleep with one of these men and claim him over time these guys will just start morphing and theyll just start saying ridiculous preposterous shit debbie wants to guard the front door do you have a problem with that no i dont as a matter of fact i think women are amazing plus im vegan and they will just they will wear patchouli they will do what the fck they have to do next thing you know poor fcking debbie at the front door why am i alone the whole story is so bananas and its one of my favorite stories so im gonna give you the whole story of the breakin at the white house with no edits and no comic exaggerations this is the real story cause a lot of people think theres some grand conspiracy theres some cabal of evil geniuses thats pulling the strings on everyone in america its most likely that people are just dumb as fck in all sorts of walks of life this is the story this is the real story about the person who broke into the white house first of all people are always worried the governments checking out my emails bro the governments watching us all the time they pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the white house he had four handguns two rifles and a machete with him they didnt even watch him he had a map on the map was washington and it had an x where the white house is theyre like youre good to go they let him go two months later this motherfcker broke into the white house and why did he break into the white house why do you break into the white house ever because you want to die you dont thats like a suicide run thats the only reason why someone runs toward the white house if you had to ask someone what kind of security do you think they have at the white house oh dude they got snipers on every corner they got lasers in the grass if you get too far they open up a door you drop right into jail nope turns out they dont even have a dog you just fcking run the guy who made it into the white house he had  rounds of ammunition in his car left that there took a knife thats a guy who wants to die hes just sitting in his fcking car going fck the government fck my exwife and fck everybody im gonna do this fck you just sprinting oh my god im doing it oh my god im doing it thinking with every step this is gonna be the last step of my life no this is gonna be the last step of my life no this and he gets to the front door its unlocked he opens it theres a girl there by herself smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall ah hes probably going why am i alive hes probably thinking he was inside for minutes for minutes running around he got tackled by an offduty officer he was probably thinking i wanted to die i dont want to go to fcking jail will somebody please shoot me then he was probably pissed where are my tax dollars going what kind of security are you fcking people running in this place imagine when obama found out a girl was guarding him he was probably like everybody everybody not that much diversity i mean what are you playing fcking fairy tale games hereobamas got a hard job cause hes the first president thats ever been around while google was here you know he could google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night right so let me see what the people have to say hed just go obama is a  im none of those fcking things freakin out shit  probably thinking why the fck did i do this i think the guy who broke into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common in that they went for it but they probably never really thought they were getting in there you cant quit once youre the president the moment obama actually got into office like good morning mr president he was probably like oh no what the fck did i do this for i didnt think i was actually gonna get in  i cant sleep im freaking out everybody wants to kill me  who the fck is guarding me looks out in the hallway theres a girl taking selfies thatd be the greatest selfie of all time a girl with her ass out duck lips in the background a dudes breaking into the white house you know im not making this up youve all seen this this is recognizable pigeontoed is a good move cause you cant get away that good you just like like theres something wrong with your back thats a recognizable pose when did that start cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures everybody just stood there looking hungry like if you saw a photo from the  and in the background a girl was going shes a fcking time traveler nobody knew that move back then somebody had to see their face oh people like that they like what im doing combo a twohole combo attractor its all over online it gets you a lot of likesi saw a gal on instagram she has eight million followers all she does is take pictures of her ass thats it shes got a winning formula she sticks with it no witty memes theres no inspirational quotes mnhmnh mnhmnh just a lot of this different ways and shes just a regular girl man im watching this im like this is a different kind of person she has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like she doesnt have a job that they like she doesnt have an occupation that they follow theyre just staring at her ass this is a new kind of human theres never been a person psychologically thats had to navigate those kind of waters if you really stop and think about it science should really step in and start looking at this dont go to south america to study some new frog that nobody gives a fck about theres a girl in florida with eight million people staring at her ass how does this girl keep a relationship what is her day like how many dick pics does she get sent how many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis is it like the national debt counter was just fcking spinning out of control constantly i bet if she turns on the notifications her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her i bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone it would be physically lighter this is a new kind of person we really have to understand theres never been a person like this before and shes just a person like that kind of influence that kind of attractant thats a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl and as a guy who has daughters i just think of that like thats kind of fcking thats weird because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her i mean i follow her but im not like those other assholes im different i care i care about who she is im a nice person im a hero or something  im different those other guys are assholes men are noble men are noble and true mmm if we get to come if men dont get to come we get real sméagollike real quick just a few months of no dates  mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you mmm oheveryone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one everybody wants to be matthew mcconaughey to save the world on a rocket ship theres people that are signing up to go to mars do you know about this theres a mission to mars a manned mission to mars where  people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on mars theyre gonna take a oneway trip to mars thats some sad shit for a bunch of reasons first of all its some sad shit cause thats  people that dont have any real friends right if its someone you love your real friend if one of my friends is gonna move to florida ill be like btch where the fck are you going youre gonna go to florida we cant hang out if you go to florida why the fck are you moving to florida man but you might be able to deal with it we can just visit each other every now and then but if your friend was gonna move to mars youd be like oh really get in the fcking car just get in the car dude take him out to death valley look around sucks right mars sucks worse get back in the car stupid jesus christ theres places in america you cant live man you dont wanna live in detroit why the fck are you talking about moving to mars people really consider moving to mars its one of the dumbest ideas ever but if you say that people will ecobro you have you ever been ecobroed these people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you as michael shermer likes to point out like puff their chest out and say that theyre probably better than you hey dude seriously you think theres something wrong with going to mars well i dont know if youve paid attention man we maybe should colonize mars cause californias almost out of water then hell nod like yeah btch were right next to the ocean what the fck are you talking about look at all that water you fly over it it takes a day the worlds blue its more water than it is not water we have a salt problem we dont have a water problem suck the salt out of the water we got a goddamn party instead of pissing and moaning too complicated bro we gotta go to neptune oh my god youre fcking crazy were a crazy race filled with crazy people were like a dude with a dirty house like man i gotta build a new house no you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen stop piling up newspapers youre never gonna read in front of your bathroom you fck were crazy oneway trip to mars a oneway trip in coach with three other people so fcking stupid theyre willing to die on mars with you great what great conversation youre gonna have its nonsense folks my friend was like theyre not gonna die on mars man if people are smart enough to figure out how to get to mars theyre smart enough to figure out how to get back heres why that doesnt make any sense people smart enough to get to mars arent going see thats the dirty secret about rocket travel ladies and gentlemen nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those fcking things no no they look at each other right before the launch and they go they talk german and they get behind giant fcking concrete bunkers they take some squarejawed cornfed dude from the middle of the country tuck a bible under that dudes arm and strap him into that giant metal dick and shoot it off into the heavens thats what we do and that is what that is that is a metal dick its a robot dick and were trying to fck the sky we are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant and theyre too filled up with people and then they gotta make a new metal dick bro we gotta go to jupiter then they make another one they shoot that fcking thing and they fill jupiter up we just keep filling the cosmos up with people and we never evolve and we never change we stay perfect like we are right now whos in youre gonna all come with me were gonna leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street and its all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy iti watched that hbo documentary a couple too many times i went clear i think i think im clear im back im back now if you havent seen  i had to watch going clear a scientology documentary cause i have a neighbor whos a scientologist and i dont even think hes gay i dont know what the fcks going on  but he sleeps really close to me you know like my beds here this fcking dudes beds like over there his house is i mean if you take away the walls hes fcking right there its like what does this crazy fck believe and scientology is a wonderful religion not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone thats ever walked the face of the earth and not by a small amount this dude never made a second draft in his fcking life everything was one draft of nonsense and he wrote more of it than anybody not in his neighborhood not in his state not in a year not in a decade more than anyone thats ever lived ever and scientology is still like i dont see any red flags i think were good i think this is legit as fck if scientology is a good religion its because other religions get to make fun of em its like its the one religion that even the mormons are like btch you believe what hold on i mean at least we dont have video of joseph smith theres some fcking shitty black and white footage of l ron hubbard with a captains outfit on you wanna explain that  why does he have all those awards on why is tom cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate what the fck is going on with you people i watched it with my mom and it was like first of all scientology they dont pay taxes thats disturbing theyre taxfree which means theyre a recognized religion by the government of the united states which means the government of the united states had to go over what they believe and went everything seems in order none of this shit seems like a cult well what the fck is a cult and whats a religion so i had to look it up turns out i dont know who wrote this but its a perfect definition a cult is bullshit its created by one person that person knows its bullshit in a religion that dudes dead so its a religion cause l ron hubbards dead so i guess they got it on a loophole i watched it with my mom and my mom was like i cant believe anybody would fall for that you made me go to catholic school the fck are you talking about there was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne and you made me call him father slow your roll lady imagine if i talked to my mom like thatoh my god jokes folks just jokes i dont have a problem with people being religious because i just think life itself is too openended its too confusing and i think were evolving and part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions we wanna seek these answers but in the meanwhile they just give you so much anxiety and it fcks with you so much theres nothing wrong with joining a cult i think you gotta just join a nice friendly one like the mormons are a good cult heres why they dont get mad at anybody like they never kill anybody like heres a perfect example matt stone and trey parker the guys who created south park they made a hilarious musical called the book of mormon its fantastic if you havent seen it its so fcking hilarious but its also brutal brutal about the mormons you know what the mormons did they went to see it and they took out a fullpage ad in the playbill it said if you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a mormon please visit our website they just took it right on the chin like champs they didnt get mad they didnt get defensive they didnt kill anybody thats a good cult they just said what do you wanna do we got nine wives shut the fck up everybody just everybody just chill just chill thats a good religion thats a good cultsome cults arent that good they get fcking testy you know the one we dont have to say who you know what im talking about theres that one that will kill you if you draw their guy come on man i cant even draw your dude what if i draw a dude drawing your dude no loopholes fckin relax bro and this isnt just theoretical people have died cause they made cartoons before the most recent paris attacks there was a magazine called charlie hebdo and they were attacked where  cartoonists were killed eleven more were wounded and they killed a cop too fcking crazy over cartoons and when you when theres radical crazy people in the world whats interesting is the reaction to radical crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weirdbecause when these people got killed over a cartoon the whole world was in shock the whole world was outraged but one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures you couldnt see em in the la times you couldnt find them in time magazine you had to go online and find them it was a dark moment for free speech because everybodys like oh i dont wanna get killed i dont wanna show the pictures it was weird until the balance because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures word got back to texas where they promptly held a draw muhammad contest in garland texas im not making a word of this up you can google it and ill wait they had a draw muhammad contest in garland texas two dudes showed up started shooting at the building they were killed almost instantly why because they were at a draw muhammad contest in texas how obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious what are you livin in a wile e coyote cartoon motherfcker you ever go to texas thats not santa monica btch thats a totally different kind of white people those are some wild west people that have computers and modern guns theyre not supposed to be there people didnt evolve in texas its not like they were monkeys then they became people and they stayed in that spot no no they landed on boats on the east coast the stubborn ones stayed the smart ones made it to california but along the way we lost a bunch of people  and some of them just stuck around yall go ahead were gonna hang back here im gonna draw the biggest dick the worlds ever seen in the sand my wifes got the biggest titties imma try to fck a snake i think it can be done they just stayed they just gathered cattle stockpiled ammo and they all talk alikeand thats why you gotta be nervous you gotta be nervous in places with accents okay its one of the reasons why i can prove that california is the best spot to live cause all the spots that suck they all have to sound like each other cause i grew up in a place like that i grew up in boston its not that the people in boston suck but the weather sucks its fcking horrible and in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning and just goes fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck fck and everybodys worried about its a real possibility you might starve to death one day you might freeze trying to walk home  so they all talk in the same way oh my god how many more months till summer ahhh when is this fcking winter gonna be over we need more firewood  they have to sound like the people around them so if other people invade like we stick together were all in this togetherthats how they are in texas too theyre like yall aint from around here are ya they have a fcking certain way of talking which is proof positive why california is the best spot try making fun of a california accent what are you gonna do speak clear and concise what are you gonna do you gonna mock us youre gonna say some shit that everybody understands theyre not supposed to be in texas folks its not even a state its a republic they were like man we aint so sure about this whole united states thing were gonna hang back hang back see how this plays out they dont have any rules they have like three pages of rule books heres how i know this im gonna tell you a fact a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas there are more tigers in captivity in texas in private collections than there are in all of the wild of the world im gonna repeat it because i know youre like oh the fear factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work no theres more tigers in dudes yards in texas than the rest of the fcking planet how is that possible because they can because they went through the rule book  it dont say shit about tigers order it up dude order it up dude one guy got a tiger and his neighbors like shit i didnt know we could get tigers and he got two tigers and the first guy was like i aint about to let this faggot outtiger me and he opened up tiger world with his oil money were gonna need those people folks if the russians invade we cant make fcking warrior babies with those chicks in marin county with fake asses and rubber lips okay were gonna need some real warrior genes were gonna need some women who wear nonironic daisy dukes they got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet and they yell out chris kyle rest in peace when you make em come we need those women if the russians come we gotta be ready think about the children think about the children while i get a sip this is super important ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are sleeping on  imagine if i had real points oh jesus christ  i love you fckers too man so excited to be here i have kids and i lie to them i get high around em too people say you shouldnt do that but they dont see it they say you shouldnt be intoxicated around your children well im not im high i call it elevated its a different thing the people who have a problem with that they dont understand what getting high is like they think youre gonna be to your kid like who are you what do you think whats the worst thing that can happen if im a little high around my kid theyre gonna get extra hugs and daddys going to be paranoid about objects look out dont go there thats it plus i have cool conversations i have a sixyearold daughter man theres not a lot of  man and  girl have in common other than the fact shes my daughter and so our conversations are normally pretty boring but when im high im like you know you call that thing your baby your doll you call it your baby but you know its not a baby right yeah i know its not a baby do you call it a baby because youre the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you maybe okay thats cool thats cool give me a hug i love you its weird man its weird raising little people theres some things that i didnt expect one of the things i didnt expect is you have to lie to them like you dont have to lie to them about a lot of things but you have to lie to them about santa claus its just one of those things man cause its like a community you have to think about what your kids gonna tell other kids because when it comes to santa claus you dont want your kid to be one of two things you dont want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that santa claus is bullshit cause that kids an asshole but you dont want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that santa claus is bullshit cause that kids a moron so you got you got a little bit of youre like oh no when do we do this when do we do this and no one knows when to do it you just let the kids figure it out then theyre like dad what the fck youre like aw oh i missed the boat i missed the boat nobody knows when to do it nobody can be honest about it they have little meetings and shit and im like when do we tell em this lady goes when theyre  theyre gonna be fcking by then i told her it was funny she didnt believe me im like oh im sorry im off by a year thats not as funny but its i didnt mean it but its this thing they want to keep the kids in the dark and they wanna pretend theyre the only one thats teaching the kid this is a weird thing that people do theyre like i teach my kids man i teach my kids eh when you see em but unless youre some freak who homeschools your children in the forest your kids gonna go to school theyre gonna go to school and theyre gonna be in a class with  other kids the teacher only makes  bucks a year and shes thinking about dick thats all shes thinking about shes thinking about getting stuffed shes a young fertile woman who loves kids and shes writing on that chalkboard and the kids all huddle up and share information like yeah what did your dad tell you your dad tell you that yeah my dad says santa claus is fcking bullshit okay you ever go near a chimney its that big what the fck teachers coming play with blocks act stupid uh how does this work they play dumb they play dumb theyre like little prisoners trying to figure their way out they make little papiermâché heads and pretend theyre napping theyre little humans they wanna run shit who is these people telling us what to do are they being straight with us man what the fck is going on i knew the day my daughter knew that santa claus is bullshit she came home stared me down she was like maddogging me she took her book bag and just goes  walked right up to the chimney looking at me how the fck dad have you ever met santa claus no honey ive never met him but you let him in the house and theres this moment it was a moment where a sevenyearold has you at checkmate youre like oh shit i dont know whether to highfive her or to keep lying you wanna go yeah you got me you got me you got me thats bullshit no the big bang is real but this is bullshit the big bang sounds even less real the problem is you have to be consistent if youre teaching your kids nonsense you gotta teach em only nonsense you cant mix nonsense in with like real stuff like my daughter will go like how do birds fly i go birds have bones that are hollow so theyre really light then they have feathers which cover a large surface area and they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air see the air looks like its nothing right but its actually a bunch of gases thats why the trees move when the wind blows the birds can manipulate that and go through  space whoa yeah nature is crazy yeah how does the fat man get through the little hole magic christmas magic now go to bed im trying to fck your mom go to bed jokes folks just jokes cant talk like that thats how you make strippers you gotta be nice theyre little tiny people theyre adorable they dont know anything yet you gotta teach em everything you cant talk mean  kids are a lot like really fcking stupid people in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room the most confident one just starts running shit they dont have to have any more information they just have to be more confident if you get a bunch of dummies together theyre like i dont know whats going on i dont know whats going on i fcking do i fcking do the guy doesnt have to have any extra data he just has to be the only one thats confident and thats what its like in schoolmy daughters class has this fcking kid named debbie and every day its debbie says oh fcking debbie says debbie says what you dont think about that before you have kids not only are you gonna have kids but your kids are gonna make friends and then you have to make friends with the fcking parents of your kids and some of em are crazy my daughters like debbie says adam and eve are the only two people in the world and all people came from them is that true  and this is weird like you dont know what to do right you want to be diplomatic you dont want to cause problems at school but you gotta be honest and one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is i dont know im like sweetie i dont know i dont know if adam and eve is where people came from but nobody knows because no one from today is alive back then so its not something you can measure so its not something you can see so we dont know but heres what we do know you know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears yeah well some people have brains that are made out of dog shit and they get horny too and what happens is they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with its like the opposite of evolution and then they have a kid and their kid is fcked their kid is fcked and everybody wants to pretend its a level playing field theres no level anywhere you look is an eagle and a salmon level does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle no the universe does not want even it wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement okay im gonna shut this light out and im gonna go fck your mom right in the mouth all right i dont say these things i dont say any of these things i was like i dont know maybe debbies right doesnt make sense to me how would that work how would that work it wouldnt work would it adam and eve are the only two people they have kids and then where do all the other people come from i guess the kids just start fcking each other is that what happens mom fcks the kids or the yeah exactlydebbies parents they were at my house man for a cookout and the dude told me the earths  years old theyre young earth christians theyre sweet people by the way before i shit on them im gonna shit on them but before i shit on them theyre sweet theyre really nice people i hug em every time i see em theyre really kind nice people but they just found a part of their brain theyre like i have no use for this  chucked that whole logic discerningreason part this fcking things confusing theyre young earth christians which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the bible possible im like how many people believe the earth is less than  years old uh i looked it up theres a recent gallup poll that said that  of america believes the earth is less than  years old  heres why you shouldnt be scared they can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls and when you factor that in youre talking about a really small number cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say how olds the earth number one answer is older than your mothers pussy and then they hang up number two answer is fck you after that you start throwing numbers around and only  of those dummies were stupid enough to think the earth is  years old thats debbies fcking parentsso out of the people that answer polls is it even  it might be  only  are that fcking stupid and thats the  we should really be worried about were worried about the wrong  not that we shouldnt be worried about the really rich greedy people we definitely should we should definitely worry about bankers and people who theyre just stockpiling resources they could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else but they dont theyd rather just pile up their gold  yeah that  is awfulbut theres another  that freaks me the fck out that no ones talking about thats the  who leave comments on youtube videos who the fck are those freaks could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other i mean if jesus christ himself came back from the dead and had a youtube page the first comment would be you aint shit without your dad pussy these are monsters this is not a normal persons response normal people dont leave comments what a normal person does they watch a video they like it or they dont like it thats it it ends right there but what youre dealing with is the process of racism and child abuse and neglect and shitty genes and the insane clown posse is playing they know all the words and theyre wafting up their farts and their cheez doodle fingers and like an open letter to jennifer lopez let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick here  ugh dear jennifer dont you think its about time you dress a little more classy what are your children gonna see when they see just fcking think of the meanest most biting shit

song huh what are you a character in a book you piece of shitno ones honest no ones honest about how much we need other people thats why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that dont need people the people who just walk away from it all like wow what a rebel but in real life we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement so think about that youre in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers and the worst shit they can do is leave you alone were fcking weird we are weird cause what we are really is were some weird superorganism that like needs each other in some sort of strange way but were all in denial im kind of a loner oh shut the fck up theres no such thing its not real every person in this room me included all of us we are all a calculation were all an ongoing onrunning calculation of all the interactions youve ever had with all the people that youve ever met and you do a bunch of things that people like and start doing more of that youre like ill do more of that you find things that people dont like youre like ill keep that shit to myself hmm i dont like that feeling hmm thats what we do thats what we do its weird we dont want to admit it but thats who we all are and im just telling you this because ive never been more of a btch right now i have slowly but surely bent until im in this position this is how im riding out my days just like this okay okay okay okaybut im also telling you right now that im not going out like bruce jenner oh thats right politically correct san francisco heres my take on this bruce jenner thing and you know everybody has their own not really this is what everybodys take is this is the take that youre supposed to have hes always been a woman trapped in a mans body maybe definitely maybe definitely people are like that definitely there are people who were born in the wrong gender and am i saying they should stay their gender no who gives a fck you should do whatever you wanna do you should be happy you should be free i dont care what you do but its also possible that maybe if you live with crazy btches long enough you become one thats all im saying i dont see this discussed it is entirely possible if you put a praying mantis on a leaf it becomes the color of the leaf why because it wants to live it wants to survive it wants to be accepted by its environment you show me a man whos lived with the kardashians for ten years who didnt come out a chick and then well have some data okay cause right now we lost a fcking american olympian and i want you to have some respectwere down bruce jenner and ive got a close eye on kanye west and i dont exactly like what im seeing  look at kanye west hes a very talented young heterosexual man who starts a clothing line hes clearly jealous about taylor swift and he tweets like a cokedup stripper in the middle of the night you dont see what im seeing we are watching the plot of a fcking stephen king book play outan american athletic hero moves in with a woman whos made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone he breaks up with her she turns him into a chick the whole world tells him hes beautiful you tell me you dont see what im seeing you have to say you have to say shes beautiful shes beautiful shes not beautiful and neither am i look i look like a thumb with two thumbs okay you put me in a dress id be even more disgusting beautys unusual theres a lot of cool shit that isnt beautiful sixtyyearold dudes in skirts are on that list jesus fcking christ what kind of games are we playing here why are you lying to children thats beautiful what are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose is that beautiful too daddy explain ahhh bang i cant the worlds gone fcking bananas what youre saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive you should be embarrassed at what youre doing youre doing this just to get laughs at someone elses expense maybe or maybe bruce jenner lived with demons maybe they waited by the bed until they knew he was in heavy rem sleep so they could assume their true form  climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black ravens claws clutched the edge of the bed and just whispered in his ear   bruce  we would like you better if you were one of us  i cant i cant be one of you i was i was born a man nonsense   nonsense bruce you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth youre free bruce  your lips are too thin for the cover of vanity fair huh what wait wait did you say the cover okay are you fcking with me because you know the covers always been my dream it can be real  it can be real all dreams can be real through surgery sleepthank you very much san francisco i had a great fcking time with you savages lets take a selfie shit we got it putting together one of these fcking specials is stressful as shit i appreciate the fck out of all you

marriage his beef with babies and the time he met bill clintonall right petunia wish me luck out there you will die on august   thats pretty good all right hello hello chicago nice to see you again thank you that was very nice thank you look now youre a wonderful crowd but i need you to keep your energy up the entire show okay because no no no thank you some crowds some crowds they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go so i dont judge those crowds by the way okay weve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room weve all made a happy birthday sign wait you get that poster board up and youre like i dont need to trace it i know how big letters should be to begin with a bigass h followed by a bigass a and oh no oh god okay all right real skinny p with a high hump and then well put the second p below the hump of that first p sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation and now i have no room for the y so ill do a kind of curledup noodle y block letters and cursive look good together and then you go to write birthday and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with happy youre like yeah but the past is the past bigass b surely more letters will fit in the same spaceyoure very friendly here in chicago i mean were all violent here but youre very friendly no really and i dont like confrontation cause ive never been in a fight before though maybe you could tell that from the first moment i walked out on stage i dont give off that vibe some people give off a vibe of right away theyre like do not fuck with me my vibe is more like hey you could pour soup in my lap and ill probably apologize to you when i walk for real my feet go out like this im so open and vulnerable i look like a doll that you point out molestation on show us on this white comedian where the man touched youits been a while since ive been home to chicago i got married since then thank you i married my wife i love saying my wife it sounds so adult thats my wife its great you sound like a person i said it even before we were married we were just dating and we were once getting on an airplane and annas ticket didnt say anything and my ticket said priority access it doesnt matter why but we were getting on and i said uh can my wife board with me and they were like yes of course right this way and i was like oh that is so much better than all those times i was like can my girlfriend come and yeah i shouldnt have said it that way but still my wife just has some kickass to it you know get away from my wife no one talk to my wife marriage is gonna be very magical i didnt kill my wife thats like ooh whos that fella i bet he did kill his wife being married is so nice i never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself thats not really a joke thats just a little sweet thing i like to say cause id been in relationships where i got cheated on like long ones i dont know if youve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on but it changes your whole worldview cause when i was a kid i used to watch americas most wanted you know how kids do and i would always think to myself how could another person kill someone how could a human being kill another human being and then i got cheated on and i was like oh okay im not gonna do it but i totally get it and i dont mean in that way of like no one else can have you i dont care about that its just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly they have a lot of information anyone whos seen my dick and met my parents needs to die i cant have them roaming aroundi talked to a lot of people before i got engaged you know and i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married this is an old expression people say this they say why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free you ever heard that before its a bananas insulting expression to an entire gender but also it makes no sense why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free youre not allowed to milk a cow that you dont own thats not even a situation was that a problem at one point like in the dairy community was that happening a hundred years ago in some village some dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like ahhaha i take your milk and the farmer was like well then this is your cow now and he was like no no proof of purchase and he ran off into the night that sounded dutch right you know what that you know what that expression means it means why would you marry a woman if shes already having sex with you which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore now its like why buy the cow uh maybe because every day the cow asks you when youre gonna buy it and  you live in a really small apartment with the cow so you cant avoid that question at all and also the cow is way better at arguing than you are and the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue why buy the cow uh maybe because every time another cow gets bought you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale and your cow looks over at you the entire time like and does not enjoy the sale at all even though shes the one that wanted to go to the sale and shes especially mad because that farmer and cow met like eight months after you guys met why buy the cow well lets be real here youre very lucky to have the cow that you do have roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for john by the most liberal of estimates there have been about eight cows total several unmilked and a lot of people think that you like bulls and if you just bought they assume it when you search your name the third thing to come up is like john mulaney bull and if you just bought the cow nobody would say that anymore theyll still say it cause there are those guys who they buy a cow and then on the side total matador but but for real chicago why buy the cow lets be real why buy the cow because you love her you really do and yeah yeah sure shes a bossy little jew but  she takes care of you and you dont wanna be some old man stumbling around like hey you seen any loose milkmy wife is jewish shes a new york jew i did it now i was raised catholic i dont know if you can tell that from the everything about me my wife is jewish i grew up catholic so we got married by a friend being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families religions while confusing the elderly people at the wedding whats the name of the bishop thats actually standup comedian dan levy he was the host of mtvs your face or mine i saw a lot of catholic weddings though because i was an altar boy and a hush falls over the room isnt it weird how that became a scandalous thing that was just some boring shit i had to do on weekends but now its like saying i was a french maid for a period of time i was treated well in my day i worked for a variety of sirs no being an altar boy was just a boring gig you know youd serve mass and then youd serve weddings sometimes my brother was once an altar boy at a wedding and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big packed church in chicago where we grew up and the bride was coming down the aisle and the organ was playing and all the pews were filled and the bride got all the way to the altar and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride and right at that moment the other altar boy said aw shes ugly and then they looked and they were right next to the video camera and i know thats awful but wouldnt you give a million dollars to see that wedding video it was the best moment of this stupid womans life and shes walking down the aisle and the organs like and she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of god and right at that second for no reason at all some cheetofingered ratmustached  prick decides to go aw shes ugly hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like aw shes beautiful shes enchantingi grew up catholic i dont go to church anymore but i went on christmas eve with my parents cause you know how you lie to your parents so we go into the church and i was like i got this under control and then i got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit no i was going through mass and i was batting like  and then in the middle of mass the priest said peace be with you and everyone said and with your spirit and i was the one  asshole going and also with you what huh what huh what when when for those of you that arent catholic i dont mean to exclude you even though we love to exclude you but theres a part in church where the priest says peace be with you and for many many years we all said – and also with you – very good but they changed it to and with your spirit because thats what needed revamping in the catholic church that was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease in rome they were like lets see what problems can we solve problem one no im actually glad they changed that though i never liked and also with you i always found that clunky and also with you thats not how you talk – have a nice day – and also you having one its just a little bit wrong isnt it its just a little off like when someones like how are you and youre like nothing much and it sort of makes sense never begin a sentence with and also you just immediately sound caught offguard it sounds like if at the first church ever like they werent expecting it like the priest was like hey this is the first time weve ever had church i just wanna say peace be with you and they were like what oh uh yeah and also you should have some hey thats good lets keep that for  years and then change it to trick johnmy wife and i dont have any children we have a dog we have a little puppy named petunia shes a tiny little french bulldog puppy i like having a puppy thats a bulldog cause its like having a baby that is also a grandma her body is young her face is as old as time she definitely saw the nazis march into paris she always gives me this look of like oh the things i have seen you cocksucker you have no idea the gestapo threw my printing press into a river but go tell your fucking jokes bring me my dish she said that petunia petunia is my best friend in the world i give her a million kisses a day she does not like me and barks at me and bites me all day long we had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because petunia is a bad dog we tell her that every day we go hey youre bad at being a dog so the trainer came into the apartment sorry didnt even walk into the apartment walked into the threshold and went oh okay like she was an exorcist or something she said i see what the problem is she said petunia has become the alpha of the house and then she pointed at me she said you are no longer the alpha of the house and in the back of my head i was like i was never the alpha of the house i turned to my wife i was like lets pretend itll be fun yes my title of alpha which i once had how can i reclaim it because that was a thing that existed at one time she said you need to show dominance over your puppy these are things people say to me i said how do i do that she said well let me ask you this who eats dinner first you or petunia i was like petunia eats dinner first she eats dinner at  pm cause shes a foot long and two years old she said no you need to eat dinner first because the king eats before anyone else eats oh yes and what a mighty king i will be eating dinner at  in the afternoon look upon your sovereign petunia and tremble my lands stretch across this entire one bedroom and i eat dinner whenever i choose as long as it works for the schedule of a dog she said now you dont actually have to eat dinner before petunia you just have to convince petunia that youve already eaten so for the past month i shit you not before my wife and i give petunia her dish we take down empty bowls and spoons and in front of her we go mmm dinner mmm good dinner like were space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote but they didnt work that hard on mmm were eating dinner meanwhile petunias just staring at us with her paul giamatti face like youre not eating dinner cocksucker dish nowi have a wife and a dog and we just bought a house we have a new house it was built in the  but it was flipped in  which means its haunted but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash actually we didnt buy a house a bank bought a house and im allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while i pay it off for  years the woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for  years and she said so for instance this is what youll pay in july of  and i burst out laughing i was like  thats not a real year by  ill be drinking moon juice with president jonathan taylor thomas im not gonna be writing you a paper check i like having a house but i loved looking for a house cause i love real estate agents i mean they are the true heroes they really are have you ever watched hgtv real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives every episode of hgtv is like craig and stacia are looking for a twostory aframe thats near craigs job in the downtown but also satisfies stacias need to be near the beach which is nowhere near craigs job with three children and nine on the way and a max budget of  lets see what lori jo can do on this weeks episode of you dont deserve a beach housei loved our real estate agent it was so fun to hang out with her it was like hanging out with my mom cause you know real estate agents always look like your mom and they have various chicos accoutrements they always have kind of fun mom energy and theyre always so excited to see you two we would have little conferences before we walked into a house shed go lets talk lets talk before we go in were like two feet from the door so theres no toilets and i know that was on your list but i think i can get him to budge lets go so wed have a real estate agent and then like the house would have a real estate agent whos just some guy sitting in a big chair and these two always hated each other theyd be like hi tony hi kim its like jesus christ what were you two in the eagles together what is the animosity about our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives more than anyone in our family she hinted about it constantly every room she walked into shed be like so this could be an office or maybe a nursery yeah no like we said we dont know if were gonna have  no no i know i know you know you dont know if youre gonna have em but you know you know you never know sometimes you dont know whats gonna happen and then you know something happens well yeah thats how all of life works okay all right okay uhhuh mmm this is an onfire garbage can could be a nursery she showed me a backyard once she goes i dont even like this backyard for you i was like oh do tell she said its all pavement i think you should have some grass out there you know in case you have a couple little guys running around in the grass and i got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids i was like hey lady i went outside about as much as powder from the movie powder my children are not gonna be playing out on grass they will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles these are my children and thats my wifei didnt mean to make it sound like we dont want children we dont but i didnt mean to make it sound like that see i just dont think babies like me very much sometimes babies will point at me and i dont care for that shit at all like ill be on an elevator and a baby will be there in its big like stroller activity tray just like working on one cheerio with bobby fischerlike intensity and itll look up at me and go i like to lean in and go stop snitchin motherfucker and then walk off cause youre never too young to learn our national nosnitching policy my friends have babies and i dont do so well with them i had a runin with a twoyearold girl i know there are better ways to start that story but my friend jeremy has this twoyearold girl and i really like her shes a sweet kid i really like his daughter a lot but i was over at his familys house for the fourth of july and he had his daughter on his knee and it was a very lovely day his whole extended family was there and he was bouncing his twoyearold up and down and he pointed at me and he said to his twoyearold do you know who that is thats your uncle john and i was like oh my god thats so sweet im her uncle john and then the baby pointed at me and said uncle john has a penis i thank you for laughing because no one did that day fell deadly silent is what they all did hey do you know what youre supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says he has a penis no im asking cause i dont know what to say in that situation heres what i went with that day i said oh come on i dont know i thought thatd be good but then it just made it worse cause it sounded like the baby and i had an arrangement not to talk about it and she had violated my trust like the baby had been like do you have a penis and i was like yes i do but youre a baby so discretion is key and then the next day she goes he has a penis and i go oh come on someone cant keep a secret luckily jeremys wife saved the day the babys mom saved the day she came in and she picked up the baby and she was like its okay shes just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot arent we all and by the way it wouldve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina like if a grown woman had walked in the room and the baby had been like she has a vagina the woman could be like yes i do and its magnificent and we would all be like hooray you are brave no one wants to applaud the penis of a  weirdoits fun to be married ive never been supervised before im supervised she studies what i do like an anthropologist shell be like sometimes he will watch a movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him i had no supervision when i was a kid we were free to do what we wanted but also with that no one cared about kids i grew up before children were special i did very early  right before children became special like i remember when milk carton kids became a thing when they were like hey we should start looking for some of these guys i dont think theyre just blowing off steam no one cared about my opinion when i was a little kid no one cared what i thought sometimes people would say what do you think youre doing but that just meant stop they didnt actually wanna know my thought process they didnt want me to be like well i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs so that when i lit off the bottle rocket the eggs would explode everywhere oh well thats very interesting and what brought you to this experiment oh well thank you for asking well you know how im filled with rage im so horny and angry all the time and i have no outlet for it so eggs your opinion doesnt matter in elementary school either it matters in college college is just your opinion just you raising your hand and being like i think emily dickinsons a lesbian and theyre like partial credit and thats a whole thing but in elementary school it doesnt matter what you think it just matters what you know you have to have answers to questions and if you say i dont know you get an x on your test and you get it wrong and thats not fair cause your brain has never been smaller also thats not how life works im in my  now if you came to me now and you were like hey john name three things that the stamp act of  accomplished id go i dont know get out of my apartment you know but when youre a little kid you cant say i dont know you should be able to that should be an acceptable answer on a test you should be able to write in i dont know i know you told me but i have had a very long day i am very small and i have no money so you can imagine the kind of stress that i am under or if its one of those true or false questions you should be able to add a third option which is whos to say kids are much more supervised now but also they have a lot of rights like thats the biggest civil rights increase ive seen in my lifetime the rights of children have gone through the roof i had no rights when i was a little kid i remember one time i walked into a supermarket by myself and i walked in through the double doors and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went no and i went all right and i turned around and left thats how broken i wasand there werent special things for kids the way there are now like we would just go see movies any movie like back to the future that was a movie everyone could see kids could kinda see it great movie right i rewatched it recently its a very weird movie marty mcfly is a  high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist and i shit you not they never explain how they became friends they never explain it not even in a lazy way like hey remember when we met in the science building they dont even do that and we were all fine with it we were just like what whos his best friend a disgraced nuclear physicist all right proceed what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie two guys had to go in and do that they had to be like okay we got an idea for the next big familyactioncomedy all right its about a guy named marty and hes very lazy hes always sleeping late okay is he cool like ferris bueller no but he does have this best friend whos you know a disgraced nuclear physicist im confused here this best friend this is another student no no no no this guys either like  or  even we dont know how old this guys supposed to be but one day the boy and the scientist they go back in time and they build a time machine whoa okay i think i see where youre going here they build a time machine and they go back in time and they stop the kennedy assassination ah oh wow thats a really good idea i mean we didnt even think of that all right well what do they do with the time machine well now im embarrassed to say ah well all right all right all right we thought we thought it would be funny you know if the boy if he went back in time and you know he tried to fuck his mom i dont know we thought thatd be fun for people but no good point no he doesnt get to he doesnt get to cause this family friend named biff he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son the dads gotta beat the rapist off of her and also were gonna imply that a white man wrote johnny b goode so were gonna take that away from em well this is the best movie idea i have ever heard in my life were gonna make three of them now you say they go to the past how about we call it back to the past no no no back to the future right but they go to the past yeahkids have it very good now my friends a teacher she told me that uh the parents will take the kids side over the teacher now thats insane that never happened my parents trusted every grownup more than they trusted me i dont mean coaches and teachers any human adults word was better than mine any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like excuse me your kid bit my dick and my mom would be like john edmund mulaney did you bite this nice mans dick and i would be the only one whos like hey doesnt anyone wanna know why his dick was near my biters in the first place isnt anyone curious as to how i had access dont get me wrong my parents love us they just didnt like us we werent friends people are now like my moms my best friend i was like oh is she a super bad mom my parents didnt trust us and they shouldnt have trusted us we were little goblins we were terrible i remember one time we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids three weeks before we went to the resort my dad sat us down and he said all right were going to a resort and ive just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm and we were like oh yes yay yes now im telling you three weeks in advance so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm oh were gonna freak out so bad yes john you have a question how did he lose his arm thats exactly what you wont ask and then i did ask i went into the kitchen one day and i was like so howd you lose your arm and he was like well i was born with only one arm and i was like nahno my parents loved us its just like they were the cops you know and we were criminals so we didnt get along we only got along in that way that like cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals like when my dad and i would talk it was like that scene in the movie heat when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner we kind of had that rapport of like hmm were not so different you and i you have your law practice and me i have all these fucking markers i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking a rule we had a rule in our house you were not allowed to watch tv on a school night so every school night i would  be watching tv and i would hear my dad coming i would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book magazine periodical anything and id open it and pretend to be doing homework my dad would walk in the room and he would go what are you doing are you watching tv and id go no man im not watching tv and the tv wouldnt even be dark yet it would still have like a neon green halo around it itd be sizzling like a glass of pepsi and i would look my dad in the eyes and go no im just reading this yellow pagesmy dad loved us he just didnt care about our general happiness or selfesteem i remember one time we were really little kids i have two sisters and a brother and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to wisconsin my dad was driving going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood you remember that era where we were like how much wood can we get on this car without it catching on fire but then the big announcement we here at plymouthchrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car for all those times youve looked at your minivan and thought huh it needs a belt so were going on the highway weve been on the road for three hours and in the distance we see a mcdonalds we see the golden arches and we got so excited we started chanting mcdonalds mcdonalds mcdonalds mcdonalds and my dad pulled into the drivethru and we started cheering and then he ordered one black coffee for himself and kept driving and you know as mad as that made me as a little kid in retrospect that is the funniest thing i have ever seen in my entire life how perfect is that he had a vanload of little kids and he got black coffee the one thing from mcdonalds no child could enjoy my dad is coldblooded he once shushed a kid during lion king on broadway that actually happened we were at lion king on broadway and there was a fiveyearold behind us going look its pumbaa look its timon and my dad turned around and said are you going to talk the entire time hes my herothe weirdest thing when i was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed they scared us about it constantly and ive been on tour this year marijuana is legal in  or  states in some form or another its insane yeah well all right dont whoo if youre white its always been legal for us come on sir we dont go to jail for marijuana you silly billy when i was arrested with a onehitter at a rusted root concert i did not serve hard time i think i got an award eighteen or  states and by the way i agree its a very good thing but its also a really weird thing because this is the first time ive ever seen a law change because the government is just like fine you know ive never seen it before like gay marriage and healthcare we have to battle it out in the supreme court and be like gay people are humans and theyre like well think about it but with weed it was just something we wanted really badly and we kept asking them for  years like excuse me and then suddenly the government became like cool parents and theyre just like okay here take a little wed rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else blah blah blah blah blah those stupid parents and thats a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly it would be on our sitcoms wed be watching saved by the bell wed be having a great old time and then suddenly a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks and theyd always hold the joint the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way theyd always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint like its a skull in a shakespeare play and now its legal and that is great news unless youre a weed dealer and then it is terrible news and i dont just mean because theyre about to lose out to amazoncom i more feel bad for weed dealers cause theyre about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product and we dont show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products like when the chinese food delivery guy comes we dont let him hang out after hes delivered the chinese food and we dont look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls were hanging out with to try to preserve the relationship and we definitely dont give him some of the chinese food hes never like hey can i get in on those dumplings and were like yeah were all friendswhat are you on your phone hey vneck hey – whats your name – sam sam cool what do you do to afford vnecks sam typing numbers ah numbers the letters of math im sorry to bother you i dont mean to single you out i hate when people get pulled out of the audience like are you familiar with the cirque du soleil sam theyre a group of french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one we once went to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was a kid and my brother came and he was  years old you remember being  when youre like no one look at me or ill kill myself and these french bastards come into the crowd being like le volunteer and they pulled my brother up on stage and i was like no and they brought him up and they reached into his sweatshirt and they were like and they had planted a bra and they pulled out a bra and they were like and everyone at navy pier was like ah ha ha ha ha and my brother was like thats great i have had other jobs besides comedyi was an office temp for a while i really miss that i loved being a temp because i would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week and then you just get to retire like lou gehrig youre like thank you no one will ever see me again and theyre like goodbye i worked at an office once on  street in new york city i was there for a couple weeks i was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle this woman named mischa sat in the other cubicle i want to get the number right i think mischa had about  photos of her daughter up in her cubicle almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter a beautiful mindstyle i think about mischa two times a week because of a phone call she had next to me one day it was one of my first days and i was sitting next to her and her phone rang and this was her call and im quoting her phone rang and she said hello hush and then she hung up think about that two times a week and i didnt know her well enough by then to be like hey what kind of a person are you you know who could she have been talking to hello hush this was a place of business my only thought was that it was the ceo of the company being like mischa help im doing a crossword puzzle i need a fourletter word for be quiet right now – hush – youre promotedi temped at a little web company on  street in new york city it was a small web company owned by this old man who was old old old money new york his name was henry j finch iv like old old old money like his money was in molasses or something he owned this web company i have no idea why he owned this web company i think he won it in a rich mans game of dice and small binoculars or something mr finch wore linen suits he had suspenders he had a bow tie he had a hat he had a cane with an ivory handle im giving you more description than you need cause i need you to believe me this was a real person i knew in the  century mr finch was in his  he had an assistant named mary she was in her  she was korean i dont know why he had an assistant he did not need one unless he needed someone to be like remember mr finch at five oclock you need to keep looking like a hardboiled egg one day mr finch came into the office it had been raining everything im about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon mr finch walked into the office and he was wearing a raincoat he was wearing a rain hat and he had his cane and he walked in and he said and im quoting ah one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet and when one feels like a duck one is happy and then mary yelled ooh ducklings to which mr finch replied too old to be a duckling quack quack and then walked into his office i think about that every goddamn day i mean imagine youre me youre a  temp and youre so hungover and you just wanna die every day and then that happens in front of you and i dont know gives you hope and i did that a little fast let me break that conversation down for you mr finch walked in and he began a conversation the way anyone would ah one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet the rain and when one feels like a duck one is happy now thats debatable but rather than debate that point mary brought up a new separate but interesting point which was ducklings but mr finch ever the realist about his own age and mortality said ah too old to be a duckling as if to say my duckling days are behind me mary dont you see im a duck now and to prove it well ill say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has quack quack and i knew right at that moment by the way that it meant nothing to mr finch what he had said crazy people are like that they have unlimited crazy currency like if i had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like hey finch you remember that time you were like too old to be a duckling quack quack he would just be like ah perhaps i did quack but such is life for an old knickerbocker like me like hed say something else crazythats the wonderful thing about crazy people you know is that they just have unlimited currency the things they say mean nothing to them but they mean everything to me i was once walking into penn station in new york i was walking down  street towards eighth avenue im walking down  theres this woman standing at eighth and  i have my little roller suitcase you can all imagine im walking towards her shes smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore shes watching me walk kind of scanning me up and down as if she had terminator vision where she could see little bits of data like little honky ass and could read information as i walked past her she said this to me i walked past her and she said and im quoting eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs very dirty yes a very upsetting thing to hear yes im sorry you all had to hear that but at least you all got to hear it as a group i was alone out there that afternoon and she said this totally unprompted eat ass suck a dick and sell drugs it wasnt like i had paused in front of her and been like what should i do with my life so i walk away from her with this todo list and i like structure i like a todo list it did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along when you really think about it cause it starts in a pretty rough place it starts with just about the worst task a todo list can start with but by the end you have your own small business and isnt that the american dream when alls said and done that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick one day you can sell drugs imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs and you were like but i this has been a real thrill to perform here by the way i just wanna say that in all sincerity thanks for coming to this really really appreciate iti wanna tell you one more story before i get out of here about the night i met a guy named bill clinton now i dont some of you know who that is for those of you that dont he was president of the united states from  until  and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor of the united states of america now i know you know who bill clinton is but i was doing a show at a college and i mentioned bill clinton and like they kind of didnt know who he was like sorry they knew the name right but they only knew this  bill clinton whos a very different bill clinton have you seen his ass lately what the hell is he trying to pull hes all thin now and he wears these little tight suits and hes got these grandpa reading glasses like hey i cant do nothing to nobody no more oh me im just an old old man i dont have the appetites you know and hes always flying around the world with bill gates trying to cure aidsthat is not the bill clinton that we all signed up for  years ago our bill clinton was like a big fat buddy garrity from friday night lightslooking guy who played the saxophone on arsenio and his work in the std community was not in curing anything at that time that was the man we all elected president that was the bill clinton that i met i got to meet bill clinton when he was governor clinton in  when he was first running for presidentand i got to meet bill clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as bill clinton theyre a little younger but they went to the same college so when he was first running for president he would have all these big like alumni fundraisers and everyone who went was invited to go now this was really cool for a couple reasons one i got to meet bill clinton but two i got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president and that is super funny to see cause think about some of the people you went to school with now imagine theyre becoming the president imagine sam was becoming the president it would stir up strong emotions and my parents had very different opinions on bill clintonmy mom loved bill clinton cause bill clinton was always a really charismatic handsome guy i mean think about how many women he got in the  when he looked like frank caliendo doing john madden now imagine him as a college student and my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then where late at night if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home that sounds good right so my mom tells me that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night just being like hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home hey can i walk ya home and one night my mom was leaving the library and bill clinton was like hey can i walk ya home and my mom was like hell yes so this is absolutely true my mom little ellen stanton walked arminarm with bill clinton to her dorm and she was like you know i wanted to invite him up for a beer and i was like thanks im nine but her roommate was upstairs so she lost her chance with bill clintonnow my dad on the other hand hated bill clinton because my parents were dating during this time and also my dads a much more morallyupright conservative kind of guy he always told me that he hated it in college that bill clinton could quote get away with anything can you imagine how he felt laterso one day this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton my mom opens it first and she goes oh we have to go we have to go see bill and without looking up at her my dad just says why its not like hes gonna remember you one black coffee same motherfucker so my mom says fine ill go and ill take john and i was like hell yeah and i slid in the room in my first communion suit ready to go cause i loved bill clinton i was ten years old if you were a kid when bill clinton was first released it was the most exciting thing ever wed never seen a cool politician before and he would go on mtv and hed have cool answers to kids questions theyd be like governor whats your favorite food and hed be like i dont know fries and wed be like yay we eat friesi learned to play his campaign song on the piano it was dont stop by fleetwood mac from rumours an album written by and for people cheating on each other he let us know who he was right away so i went with my mom as her date to reconnect with governor bill clinton we walked into the ballroom it was a big hotel ballroom it was the palmer house hilton big hilton hotel ballroom walked into the ballroom it was packed with people its actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive remember so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in its packed with people the sorry the end where harrison ford as dr richard kimble bursts in to confront dr charles nichols right okay so that ballroom so my mom and i walk in its packed with people why does kimble confront nichols well i know we all know this but no no but but but kimble he found out that nichols along with devlin macgregor and lentz who has mysteriously died they had hired frederick sykes the onearmed man to kill kimble kimbles wife wasnt even the target i know we all know this but they were gonna kill kimble because he wasnt gonna approve certain liver samples to pass  so kimble finds out about all of this and of course hes furious and he bursts into the ballroom and he goes you switched the samples and dr nichols is like ladies and gentlemen my friend dr richard kimble what accent did that guy have by the way he goes you switched the samples and you doctored your research so that you could have provasicanyway so its that ballroom so we walk into that ballroom it was packed with people it was packed with people a real whos not of chicago celebrities walter jacobson was there walter jacobson was the local fox anchor hed do fun things where hed go undercover as a homeless person and hed be like oh what time is the soup and theyd be like man youre walter jacobson he was there everybody and on the far side of the ballroom under a spotlight we saw a little bit of silver hair and it was him bill clinton the comeback kid but he was surrounded by reporters and photographers and secret service so what are you gonna do well if youre my mom you ball up the back of my sport coat and you push me forward like a human shield and then you start jogging while yelling this tenyearold boy has to meet the next president of the united states kind of implying that i might be dying my feet were not on the ground she was swinging me like a snowplow i was just mowing down fat chicago democrats i pushed past all the reporters i pushed past all the photographers we pushed past all the secret servicewe land at bill clintons feet bill clinton turns looks at my mom and says hey ellen cause he never forgets a bitch ever my mom melts she goes hi bill then it is revealed that she has no plan so she pushes me towards clinton and she goes this is my son john and hes also going to be president and i was like what the hell are you talking about im not gonna be president and i know now that im definitely never gonna be president not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly based on my tenyearold memory bill clinton is about  feet tall and he leaned down because well i was wearing this button that i bought outside the fundraiser it was a cartoon button of george h w bush and it had a quail flying over his head and it was shitting on his head and it said birdbrained and i thought it was very funny and bill clinton leaned down so that only i could hear and he said hey man i like your button and i said you can do whatever you want forever and he took my advice and it was the best night of my entire lifeand i got home that night i got home that night and my dad was still awake like reading angry under one lamp just like and i went up to him and i went hey im gonna be a democrat and im gonna vote for bill clinton and without looking up at me my dad just said you have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair you know how you talk to a child so heres the end of that story that was lets flash forward five years to  it is now  i am a sophomore in high school bill clinton is in his second term as president and on the morning that the monica lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of the new york times it had been on the drudge report and then it was on the cover of the new york times that morning i wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face i am a teenager asleep in bed and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach and i open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work and he says the other shoe just dropped and then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend bill clintongood night chicagomorejohn mulaney standup transcripts share this article

if youre actually hot or if you just have facial hair you know what i mean you guys always have a hat mustache beard an ipa blocking your nose and mouth im like are you attractive or are you just

like itim glad you guys came out i know that everybodys had a really crazy past couple years i had an especially crazy  i actually got divorced a week before covid hit oohyeah so whos ready for some comedy oh and i just start crying no its okayi think the craziest part about getting divorced is having to change your emergency contact back to your mom it would be less embarrassing to use a stranger from craigslist truly but other than that it went pretty smoothly like we still have a lot of love and respect for each other hes also a comedian so we didnt have a lot of assets to split up its not like there was a summer house and a boat it was like do you want the batman begins dvd who gets the good spatulaand after some time had passed we decided that we were gonna try and be friends again and thats always a little weird the first time you try hanging out with an ex as a friend when he saw me he fistbumped me i was like well honestly i would rather have you fist me that would feel less physically uncomfortable than this nightmare just put us through hated that absolutely notand ive had the deadly peanut allergy for most of my life so for the eight years we were together he had to stop eating peanut products because if he did and then kissed me my throat could close so when i saw him i was like oh whats it like to eat peanut butter again he goes oh man we should have broken up a long time ago i dont even blame him have you had peanut butter i cant compete with that i hate that the person im with has to give that up that puts way too much pressure on me to be worth the trade off right like youre gonna rob a man of reeses for the rest of his life bitch you better be pretty openminded in the bedroom im gonna make a man stop swallowing something delicious well get ready to start swallowing something gross you gotta fill the void that snickers left missionary with the lights off aint gonna cut it anymore so had to learn some new moves and watch some tutorials its what i call porn its just educational for me now i just watch with a little notepad like oh pretend to gag seems goodi do think its easy when you get married to stop trying as hard in bed but god if you get divorced and you start trying to date again its like having to come back outta retirement you know its like you gotta start stretching get ready to run another bj  like no i just did this and somebody moved the finish line back another  years ugh cant even see itdo we have any married people here tonight that was a pretty sad sound you guys were faking it a little bit like eh some of you just treated it like a silent auction you were like just so sadanybody here been married for a really long time like over  years you guys are so cute how long have you been married  give it up for  thats a long time yeah so you guys get it if youve been working the same job for over two decades you start to cut some corners right but if it is your first week at a new blowjob you are hustling you just start im sure you dudes have figure it out by now that the best blowjob you ever get from us is the first blowjob because women were so competitive we know that youre about to compare us to every other one youve ever had so we just enter the arena that night like i will be queen gimme that we pull out all our tips and tricks hurt our knees throw our back out we want a trophy we will give head to get aheadbut then you get married and you start to treat blowjobs like youre assembling ikea furniture and just skip a few steps and by the end youre like next time im hiring somebody else to do this a little righty tighty lefty loosey lets get the hell outta here we gotta go to costcoi tried to avoid the whole postbreakup identity crisis one of my friends went through a breakup and she got this dramatic haircut afterward as a revenge move against her exshes like if he sees me hes gonna know he missed out on this whole other melike a guy has ever seen a haircut and been like i never got to fuck asymmetrical lob lisa bullshityou guys never know when we change our hair right youre not even observant of yourselves before the divorce i was cuddling with my ex and i felt like my leg had been stabbed i looked down his toenails looked like he cut them with his teeth theyre all jagged like he could unlock a secret door in a haunted house i was like do you have a best friend with a matching jagged toenail you put them together and make a best friend necklace is that what youre doing im turning stone to a prison shiv and i was like what is this he goes i just didnt notice oh i sure did when you shanked my achilles tendon and im bleeding outbecause i feel like this stuff only gets worse with you guys with age like weve all seen the really old men with thick tufts of raccoon hair growing out of their ears im sure that guys wife has been telling him to trim it for years and he just cant hear her like what its like yelling into a fan its coming right back in your facei just sat next to a very old man on a plane recently and i had my notebook out and he leans over and goes its nice to see somebody writing and not on their phone and i was like aw he doesnt know im writing jokes about cum i was like oh suddenly candy crush doesnt seem so bad huh wendell when i booped him booped him on the nose love that wendelldoes feel a little weird to start over now in my thirties but at least i know now what i like and dont like in a relationship for example i dont care how hot you are im still never going to eat your ass not a fan of the devils chocolate no thank you and im fair about it i dont ask anybody to eat mine neither okay theres no need women have a lot of holes down there its like a mini golf course just skip the one thats in a lagoon just dont even look at iti

way and that is a joke i wrote next to wendell on the plane now you knowand i dont know if im alone in this but i didnt even hear about eating ass until later on in life and when i did i was like why is that even on the menu because as women you wanna seem like youre like cool and dirty and down for anything but its poop like thats not even in the same universe of things that turn me on right like thats like going to disneyland and one of the rides is beekeeping youre like what that sounds terrible and dangerous like i dont understand how the people who are eating ass all the time arent getting

on television like when she heard i was getting divorced she sent me a text that said now that youre single you can go on the bachelor or miss america i was like yeah cause marriage is what was holding me back from becoming miss america im pretty sure part of the qualifications include hasnt been paid in jello shots to tell dick jokes so i dont think im getting iti was talking about the foosball web series so my entire family and i are actually worldchampion foosball players thank you thank you i know it sounds made up i swear its real my parents met playing at a professional foosball tournament in the eighties so i literally wouldnt exist if it werent for foosball which is sad but you know some of you wouldnt exist if it werent for boxed wine so its like yeah whatever were all a little garbage lets not judge each otherit gets weirder not only is my dad a profoosball player hes also a slam poetry champion and an international yoyo man yeah my dad has the sex appeal of fanny pack crushing it and my mom is in the foosball hall of fame and theyve been training me to play since i was like two years old but since no one suspects that im a profoosball player i love to hustle people right and so i usually play against other comedians on my web series but we did this special episode where i went undercover in vegas and i hustled drunk dudes on the vegas strip so i wore this lowcut top i talked in the worst voice and my camera crew and i would go up to groups of guys and id go hi my names kelsey and i have this web series where i do things that ive never done before for the first time its called pop my cherry its silly you know so ive never played foosball before and we just found this table and i was just wondering if you guys wanna play meand every group of guys is like hell yeah bitch lets goyeah play right nowso i would play the first game terribly on purpose right i would giggle a bunch spin the rods a lot really build up their confidence and then i go okay so i think ive got the hang of it now and this is vegas so we should play for moneyand every guy would put their whole wallet on the tableand theyd hand me the ball and go here you can serve firstand thats when i pull out my foosball grip glove check mate motherfuckeryeah ive never done cocaine but i would assume its a similar rush ive only done parmesan cheese which also exhilarating and a lot cheaperso i mentioned that my ex and i we were together for a really long time so we knew so much about each other but one thing that he didnt know about me until toward the end i told him that sometimes i pee in the shower and by sometimes i mean every time and dont you guys act like you not do it too we are all swamp monsters there is no drug in the history of time with a higher addiction rate than peeing in the shower okay you think youre better than that you think youre above doing it and then you let yourself do it one time and youre like well i guess im doing this every day for the rest of my life it is the best i feel like im on vacation every day just carefree living and i thought that he and i were gonna bond over it you know like maybe we had the same dirty little secret and instead he was like what oh gross that means every time i shower ive just been standing in your peei was like i do it while im showering like the water takes it down the drain immediately youre acting like i walk into our bathroom drop my pants stand in the shower and just on dry porcelain like a serial killer and then get out put my pants back on and just leave you a puddle of urine like a feral cat i was like im gonna start peeing on your pillow give you some real problems this is nonsenseone of my friends told me that apparently were all supposed to throw our pillows away once a year and get new ones you guys been doing that feels good to be gross together huh we all have such a weird attitude toward pillows cause they cost like  bucks but we all keep the same disgusting pillows for decades like its the great depression like were some old prospector like well this heres the pillow they gave me at the orphanage and ill be god damned if this aint the same pillow i die with whypillows and towels right like we never get rid of towels they just eventually become the ones you like dry the dog with why are you holding onto so many do we all think were gonna have like a home birth someday im gonna stop some stuff upmy grandparents towels are historical artifacts at this point i dont know if youve visited your elders recently they have washcloths that look like they were woven from wheat im like did this belong to jesus i feel like im drying my face with a triscuit my eyelids are bleedingso i got on dating apps for the first time last year and they let me onto the celebrity dating app which listen obviously they use the term celebrity real loosely okay if they saw my wiki feet theyd be like absolutely not we got she cant sit with us yeah they let in somebody whos  and still shops at forever  so i for sure tricked themi know that store is trash but i just cant stop going i just love it so much the last time i was there i told the girl at the register that i found a makeup stain on this tank top i wanted and i asked if i could get a discount and she just stared at me with dead eyes and was like its already only  like do you want us to just give you the tank top and pay off your student loans this is forever  everythings stained its basically an animal sheltergod i love that store the first date i went on through the celebrity app was such a disaster i went out with this guy who was from europe originally so he had this really thick european accent and some of the words he said sounded like other words so he is telling me about his cat and he goes yeah no i love my cat but he rapes my shirts and my brain was like that cant be right nope so i sat with it for a second and i was like oh oh he rips your shirts okay sorry i just i thought you said that he rapes your shirts and with zero hesitation this dude goes yeah no he rapes my shirts and i dont understand why because hes neutered but he will not stop raping my shirts so then i had to hide my shirts and then i gave him a blanket and now thats his rape blanket and im like what the fuck am i on a hidden camera show where if this dude says rape  times before dessert he wins a jet ski is this one of ted bundys kids what i just started covering all my holes i was like i dont like this this is a bad bad vibeso i was like all right im gonna give this five more minutes so he starts telling me that he goes on boats a lot and i was like oh you ever worry about shark attacks and i swear to god he goes yeah no you dont really have to worry about sharks so much but you do have to worry about dolphins because they are the rapists of the sea i was like all right im out of here bye enjoy the jet ski im sure he won lunaticthat was my first dating app experience fortunately its been better since then im seeing a guy in his forties now he has adult children okay he has lived more life than i have he knows more things and i told him that i was hesitant to hook up with him the first time because i was on my period and he goes i dont get why guys are ever grossed out by that youre just shutting your uterine lining i was like that is the hottest thing that anybodys ever said to me i didnt even know thats what happens during my period i was like okay greys anatomy who are you the bar was set real low after ol rape blanket so im gonna just do a gentle hop over into my heart you know with your snapple fun facts about periodsi dont know any of those things somebody could come up to me on the street with a microphone and be like maam for a million dollars what happens during your period and id be like im gonna go with the egg is meltingtheyd be like were you homeschooledmy parents are playing foosball i dont know they didnt teach me these thingshes also the first guy ive ever been with who has had a vasectomy so i had some questions about that i was like when you finish is it clear like that white gatorade flavor just have glacier frost on tap whats going on im just trying to prepare myself i was like does it taste better when there arent kids in itits like or maybe its just air right like one of those pressurized keyboard dusters it was like whoosh shes like oh startles you you got to point it away or youll lose an eye you maybe fix a tirefinally i just went bill nye on his ass i was like i am blowing you in the name of science this is field research at this point and turns out its like normal i guess its kind of like beyond burger like it looks the same and then once its in your mouth youre like somethings missing this is like diet cum its another joke i wrote next to wendell he yeah he got an eyeful in that flight saw some thingsa lot of my friends are getting engaged and married right now and one of them just had an engagement party with her fiance and they played one of those games where they have signs that say him and her and they held them up when they got asked questions like whos the better cook hm who takes longer to get ready were all just like oh my god im like you guys are getting married lets get into some real shit like who has a drinking problem whos settling im like let me run this game huh and well call it getting cold feet lets test drive this son of a gunso one of the things that i learned that was hard in going from being married and living with somebody for eight years into being single and living alone is that no one touches you anymore and i know it sounds weird to say it like that but if you live with somebody theres like a fair amount of touching that happens throughout the day so my lowest point in quarantine i started watching asmr videos on youtube where a girl would hold a hairbrush up to the camera lens and she would simulate that she was brushing your hair and i would just ram my forehead up against my laptop like uh pet me rachel you dirty bitchas soon as businesses opened up i made all of the touching appointments i was like im getting a massage im getting a manicure look i made a dentist appointment just cause i missed feeling somebody in my mouth okay dont you judge me it was hard my dentist is this like  old armenian man i was like floss it up daddy use your toys he was like i prefer you call them tools i was like dmitri i need this hush your lips just tell me when to spitone of the appointments i had made was for a bikini wax and i had been going to salons before covid to get bikini waxes i had tried doing some of those like at home kits and i just learned that there are some parts of my nethers that i do not have the strength of spirit to wax myself listen to me if you can wax your own lips youre a psychopath that is some steveo jackasslevel masochism i want no part of itso id been going to the salons and then the salons closed for six months and things got scary theres so many beautiful women here tonight i feel like a lot of women started  with like a landing strip and by july it was just a full airport you can land anywhere theres a cinnabon and a panda express theres a shuttle that takes you to a rental car lot i mean employees  its a lot going onso finally the salons opened back up and i immediately made an appointment and i remembered theres that rule that the hair has to be at least a quarter inch long in order for the wax to be able to pick it up oh my godand do we need a medic are you okay are you too much for you shes like its a  show i didnt know what this was i i dont like hockey and we had a groupon but shes shes like this is not the christian wayim sorry oh yeah so i remembered theres that rule that the hair has to be at least a quarter inch long in order for the wax to be able to pick it up and i looked down and was like well thats not gonna be a problem but for the first time in my life i worried that maybe its bad if the hair is longer than a quarter inch so i called the salon so embarrassing i was like hey i have an appointment today its been a rough quarantine is there like a maximum hair requirementand this poor girl just goes i mean how long are we talkingand i wasnt prepared to answer that so i panicked and was like we could probably donate it no like i dont know if locks of love specifies which type of hair they accept but maybe somebody needs fake eyelashes i dont know we dont we dont know where that hair comes from ill just throwing em on and praying but could be pubes i dont knowbasically i feel like a lot of us were walking around kind of looking like the opposite of a porn star in  right which is totally fine my friend jay actually told me that my celebrity lookalike is this porn star named jesse rogers so i googled her and the first picture that popped up was her doing hardcore anal and got a little creeped out realizing that my friend jay saw that and thought you know who this reminds me of ol gap and butthole kelsey yeah oh backdoor club look at her go a plus what is the matter with you jaybut by the way its so nice to be able to tell that joke in person again because ive had to to tell it on mostly virtual shows the past two years and i realized that halfway through the joke everybody would just open a new browser it would just get really quiet and id be like hello everybody show me your hands i dont trust you what are you doingi had to check into a hotel on the road recently and it was early in the morning and the woman checking me on which is a little older and she goes i just have to tell you you look so much like amy adams huh i dont know if you ever hear that but you really look like herand it took all of my strength to not pull my phone out and be like you know who everybody else says i look like and just just really blast her with a b hole at  am i just i couldnt do iti do think that jesse rogers and i we do look alike we have some different hobbies you know ive never just sat on a lava lamp for example like my exhusband and i we didnt even buy a sex toy until seven years into the relationship we had just been flintstoneing that shit just very little house on the prairie just churning butter very innocent we ended up buying one of those vibrating wand things and i gotta be honest never liked it way too intense for me even on the lowest setting this thing is like for blasting rocks i was like is this what you women have been using this whole time i barely touched it to my body my feet lifted off the ground i took flight i was not turned on at all i was terrified i was like did i just puree my clit oh my god no no no no no no no this thing is meant for industrial kitchens okay its for liquefying raw vegetables its crazyso i ended up asking some of my friends about it and it turns out that they have this toy and they use it on the highest setting in order to have an orgasm i was like how have you not completely erased your vagina just sanded it down to a smooth slab of granite like a barbie crotch yeah go bowling on itand something ive learned about you dudes is that a lot of you guys like stuff that vibrates too so one night before the divorce my ex and i were out drinking id had a few gin and hams as you do and when we got home i was just feeling a little extra spicy so i decided to crank it to  just to see what would happen and the moment i touched it to his junk his balls woo went up inside his body i didnt even know they could do that i was just staring at him like do they stay up there until you sneeze really hard how do you get them back have to do a hard man kegel a couple minutes went by didnt see anything i panicked i started pushing on his belly bone really hard like kinda trying to eject quarters out of a skeeball machine i was like come on get outta thereanother few minutes still nothing i was like oh i think those are ovaries now im sorry i think i gave you an accidental gender change oopsso im in therapy anybody here in therapy oh wow thats a nice response usually its just one person thats like help lets talk to you yeah i think therapy is amazing but i guess not everybody always needs therapy some people do need therapy and you can usually tell who those people are because they say things like i dont need any fucking therapy i prefer to be a burden to my loved onesyoure like uh sir this is an arbys why are you shouting youre alarming the childreni had to work on my selfworth in therapy because i kept attracting some of the wrong people one of my friends told me this quote she said once you know your worth youll stop giving people discountsand i was like well slap my tits and call me groupon babyboy ive been out here like hey you got a personality disorder and no job this pussy is  off hey no credit no problem get in herethat makes it sound like my life has been a dick buffet it has not i have a very low body count i love that thats what we call it body count like were all just fucking people to death like it sounds so system of a down for no reason you knowi think i would have a higher body count if stds didnt exist but im just so terrified to ever get one that i dont wanna gamble like i just cant believe that in  our best defense against them is still just condoms in the honor system scouts honor bro im like you lied about your height im supposed to trust you on chlamydia no kick rocks get outta herei was reading online that some of the very first condoms back in the  were really thick like they used to basically just cut up bike tires and theyve obviously gotten thinner over time which im sure was a guys idea you know i bet the women back then were pissed like but keep it girthy keep that deep dish condom on we dont have electricity this is the only joy i havei had a woman come to one of my shows recently who i think was from the  she was very old and she came up to me afterward and she was like i was a makeup artist for  yearsand at this point im thinking oh i think shes about to compliment my makeup thats so niceand then she goes your face was so oily when you were on stage it was the only thing i could look at the lights were hitting it so bright that i had to squint to look at youand thats when i heard my brain say well tonights the night we go to jail for throatpunching someones nanado you just hit a certain age where you walk around like fuck it burn it to the groundand just traumatizing people im like who is this womans poor husband you know we gotta save them i just picture him getting outta the shower and shes like your balls make me sickof course i didnt say any of that to her i was just like what powder do you recommend i have no backboneive also become selfconscious of this very specific thing did you girls have that dress code in middle school were you had to wear shorts that were longer than the length of your fingertips to your sides okay all right to prevent girls from wearing booty shorts so that was the day i learned i have freakishly long arms for my short height im only five four all the girls had a lineup and we put our arms down and i dont know if you can see whats happening right now ill show you on this side too but i did this and i looked down and i was like oh no im gonna have to wear mens jnco jeans to not get expelled im just rolling into home back with my chain wallet and lugs like lets bake these muffins diane the third member of the insane clown possei dont know much about the insane clown posse but it does make me laugh picturing those guys having to take their makeup off at the end of the night because they just they seem so tough on stage like im gonna stab this dude and bang your chick and then two hours later theyre like these neutrogena wipes are lovely oh they dont burn my eyesso before i started headlining i used to open on tour for a comedian named jim norton anybody here jim norton fan nice got some jim heads in the house so jims favorite thing to do is to humiliate people and i made the mistake of telling him that i embarrass very easily for a comedian and he just milked that every day for three years on tour when we were in public he would constantly accuse me of shoplifting we would be checking out at a cvs pharmacy and just deadpan in front of the cashier he would turn to me and go are you not gonna pay for all the things in your purse i would just start shivering like a shelter chihuahua like i would just end up paying for a lipstick that ive owned for five years i was like just take my money im so sorry i hate this it was traumatizingby far the most embarrassing thing he would do he would do with his bodyguard we traveled with this sevenfoot tall guy named kenny picture frankenstein with less people skills just an oaf and i dont know if you women have ever ordered anything on victoriassecretcom but sometimes you get that free tote bag with purchase if you have even a shred of selfrespect you immediately throw it in the garbage where it belongs i used it as my daytoday purse for seven years i have no dignity and says victorias secret in big letters on the sides like its very obnoxious and i would travel with this so when we were on tour wed have to get to the airport at five in the morning and you guys know how you look at the airport at  am right just greasy disheveled gross so id look like that and id have this bag and everybodys just quietly shuffling about the airport and all of a sudden his bodyguard would shout victorias secret model coming throughand everybody and i mean everybody would stop and look at me wideeyed and then go do you know how quickly your selfesteem goes in the toilet when you can watch a hundred people decide in half a second no shes not like oh right shes gonna go walk into traffic now thanksso im from washington state originally and they just passed this new legislation that is banning schools from continuing to use native american mascots which is great and the high school i went to our mascot was the black hawks and it takes a linguistic specialist to tell the difference between somebody saying black hawks and black cocks and let me tell you it was pretty wild growing up going to football games and watching a dozen cheerleaders shout to a stand of parents we love black hawks yes we do we love black hawks how about youand then watching everybody on the other team be like what the fuck its like the mating call of the kardashiansso i had my bachelorette party down in vegas and we went to the magic mike live show has anybody here mention of the magic mike live show oh we got a few oh are you still wet heygirl it is crazy what happens at this show they brought it back during covid which surprised me because if we are concerned about droplets women are gushing fluid at this show medically its a problem okay it changes the humidity in the room women with straight hair leave with curly hair its like a rainforest cafe in there that air is thick three cs but now that the shows back you gotta go oh it is the cream of the cock just chefs kissfor two hours these oiledup six packs just grind the stage and they sing to you they like the cream off your body and then they bring some women on stage and then they take your top off and then they take your pants off and then they fuck youno im

the sky like free williethey get you hornier than youve ever been in your entire life and then they just set you loose back into the wildsingle dudes if you were ever trying to fuck in vegas just go

relatable topics often with a selfdeprecating twistone central theme is the absurdity and humor found in aging and health james jokes about his own physical decline and the overmedicalization of

to exaggerate health concernsjames humorously addresses technology and its intrusiveness particularly through his mistrust of siri and the difficulty of deleting apps his take on modern parenting and

how to punish our kids anymore i dont even know what we can do what we cant do i dont even know what i know our parents our dads they knew how to punish back in the day they knew how to punish they did they had it exactly correct every the punishment always fit the crime perfectly because they got the belt thats whyyes you only had to get the belt once you got the belt once you never did whatever you were doing ever again then your dad just had to show you the belt and that was enough you remember that hey what did you say  yeah okay im goodyeah yes belt worked remember how out of nowhere that first time you got the belt was you were popping off at your mom you go like hey mom im not having your meatloaf tonight its horrible im not having it its very dry who puts peas in meatloaf i cant do it i cant its way too dry look up the recipe betty crocker check it out woman why is dad getting undressed whats going on what are you doing  no add ketchup to it i dont care some sauce get it going its just horrible its very dry whats up dad are you a lion tamer what is this whats this snap snap snap snap i dont know oh my god oh god  and it worked the belts worked since  bc its worked throughout history all the way up until like  when some frail dbag introduced the first time out  and thats when we lost society right there when everything burns and civilization comes to an end we can trace it all the way back to that one guy thats the guy time out it changed the game time out how can you do that can you imagine trying to convince your dad to give you a time out back in the day hey dad listen up very sorry about stealing your car last night taking it for a joy ride doing donuts in that parking lot and wiping out that whole store front but hows about this  instead of you whipping this ass with that leather strap and that massive belt buckle you got in new orleans  im thinking im gonna wander off over into the corner for a little bitmaybe think about where i went wrong maybe not i dont even know i dont know what im gonna do i might sing a song i might hum one it doesnt matter important thing is its my time its my time over in that corner and when i feel good enough and i feel like im ready to inject myself back into society i will come back here and i will tell you and well see how that goes how do you feel about that cowboy hows that  why are you getting undressed again whats going on  time out they dont even do time outs anymore now time outs are too cruel theyve become too cruel time outs oh the ch no you cant what you cant do a time out its too cruel for the child theyre alone theyre isolated theyre in the corner of the room by themselves there are other people theyre just no theyre way its in a corner theyre looking at two walls meeting its its too much for the child to deal with you cant isolate them like that any you cant you just cant isolate them they dont even do that anymore they dont do time outs anymore cause its too much they do whats called a time in its called a time in im serious what they do is the dad will take the child you sit in the middle of the room they put the child next to them they stroke their shoulder and you both kinda go over what went wrong and kinda where the child went off the tracks and once you start making them feel good about being bad  probably after like seven or eight minutes you just let them go then you stay there for like an additional four minutesjust to think about what a loser of a parent youve become  were raising baby veal thats what were doing we are we are we are were so easy on our kids and so what it doesnt help them i love my kids we all love our kids we know that but you know what they all cant be the best they cant not right away anyway this is what we tell them constantly youre the best you are the best you are so good you are the best youre the best isnt he the best yeah hes the best youre the best hes the best youre so good youre the best  no you suck

the losers are the team with the less numbers theyre the losers and they go home as a team and they try to come back and do better and sometimes that drive actually helps them thats actually the better choice to lose and try to come back because its human naturehuman nature its good for them one trophy thats all i had i would go in my room and see that one trophy id be like oh yeah thats the year we won thats it the one time that was worth it it was great i went to my neighbors house his living room is littered with trophies i know his kids im like this is criminal  im like whats this one

my body but you know what no allergies todaynada i eat whatever i want i can see a raccoon walking around midday just rip its face off clumps of hair missing doesnt matter i can just eat that thing whole and be fine an hour later  you know why cause i drank water out of a hose that was rolled up in my backyard  that sat outside in the grass in the hot sun for months at a time melting that plastic it boiled up so much it would burn your face it wouldnt even come out in a steady stream youd be ppppp  firing rusty spickets through that thing like bbs into the back of your throat until it wasnt enough and you just ripped the hose off the faucet and wrapped your lips around that  just suck all the asbestos and lead right out of the house just  go right to the source and i was fine why

the mound i was firing the ball aiming it and i was missing the plate i started walking batters and it was getting to me i loaded up the bases and i was breathing heavy i felt it i felt this heaviness and it was bothering me i started trying harder and i was walking more batters i started walking runs in im looking at my friends in the field and they were looking at me and i felt terrible i remember this cause i remember my dad who was also a coach he walked out to the mound and he gave me the greatest advice ive ever received in my entire life he literally walked up to the mound he put both hands on my shoulder looked me dead in the eyes and says hey stop aiming the ball you know what to do he said two words just throw thats all he said just throw he turned around and he walked back to the dugout and i remember its the greatest advice ive ever received in my entire life think about it anytime life has got you down there are obstacles you gotta overcome just throw thats all you gotta do just throw yesbelieve in yourself trust yourself and just throw and thats what i did i launched back into my windup and i just threw and i shattered the kids cheekbone i remember  ball bounced like  yards two more runs scored so my dad was wrong there you gotta aim the ball  in baseball thats the thats like where thats the worst advice ever to just just throw it in baseball then

loves the vibration of her lips on her teeth or something the whole nine yards whatevers involved with talking she  ever hear a baby whenever they find their voice theyre mamamama brr brr brr lala brr

i cant believe that were gonna make eggplant for thursday well have some friends over would that be good look at my reflection in the mirror i see two of me do you see two of me its really weird i cant believe the kids are standing on hardwood floor now look at that the lights are good the holidays are coming this is fun hey sit one out sit one out  i have thoughts in my head all day long weird ones how many tater tots can i fit in my mouth without dropping any  its in there but i keep it in the barn i keep it in there not my wife she doesnt have any barn doors its just freerange thoughts i see it i say it i see it in the senses and i say it look at those exit signs the light the floor everything is i see it i say it i see it i say it its like a verbal wood chipper i see it i say it i gotta say it when i see it i see it i say it i gotta say it   hey theres an ebb and flow to conversations there is fifty percent is listening its like double dutch you gotta wait for your turn  not her shes in there the whole time like i got this this is my talk this is my talk back it off can someone else talk get outta here  this is me big mac filletofish quarter pounder french fries i see coke milkshake sundaes and apple pie  you wanna talk talk go in your closet take your clothes off and talk all night long but why do i have to be there  its this emotional backboard she doesnt care what i think or say she wants me there why talk go i always gotta be there though im literally brushing my teeth getting ready for bed and i hear it  telling me things that i experienced with her i was with her all day  cant believe alan stood up in front of everybody revealing facts about his son i didnt like that at all i couldnt believe it could you believe it in my head im going yes i can you know why cause i was there  this was your point of view  this was mine i was there i experienced everything with you nanananana talking herself to sleep literally talking herself through sleep you know how much you wanna go to sleep and youre tired and shes still fighting it    finally it goes quiet sweet quiet you go to bed next morning i wake up  im brushing my teeth and it starts up again in the other room  im like what new knowledge did you pick upovernight what did you get what could you have picked up nothing new happened  but she wants me there she wants me in that conversation again doesnt care about what i have to say does doesnt matter she wants me there and she tries to get me snagged into these conversations shell like lob out half sentences to me thats what shell do shell lob them out like she fly fishing to try to catch me  i sure hope ellens gonna be okay  i usually let the first one just pass by  cause if enough time passes i can just kinda   but theres always a followup sure hope they can work through this okay we gotta engage  im thinking whats our plan our plan is we wanna get outta here as quickly as possible we have so much stuff to do but we cant try to shorten the conversation we know that cause shell sense that shes good at that and then shell tack on  minutes just out of spite so  what if i steer into it what if i go in the other way its dangerous

april   filmed in phoenix arizona at the celebrity theatre				 introfade the music out lets roll hold there lights do the lights thank you thank you very much i appreciate that i dont necessarily agree with you but i appreciate very much well this is a nice place this is easily the nicest place for many miles in every direction thats how you compliment a building and shit on a town with one sentence it is odd around here as i was driving here there doesnt seem to be any difference between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here people just kind of walk in the middle of the road i love traveling and seeing all the different parts of the country i live in new york i live in a– theres no value to your doing that at allthe old lady and the dogi live– i live in new york i always– like theres this old lady in my neighborhood and shes always walking her dog shes always just– shes very old she just stands there just being old and the dog just fights gravity every day just– the two of them its really– the dogs got a cloudy eye and shes got a cloudy eye and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together and– and shes always wearing like this old sweater dress i guess it was a sweater when she was like  but now its just like this sweater and her legs are– her legs are a nightmare theyre just white with green streaks and bones sticking out her legs are awful i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by and he was like yecch no thank you i do not want those id rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit i see these two all the time and i always look at them and i always think god i hope she dies first i do i hope she dies first for her sake because i dont want her to lose the dog i dont think shell be able to handle it if she dies– if the old lady dies first im not worried about the dog because the dog doesnt even know about the old lady this dog is aware of three inches around his head hes living in twosecond increments the second hes in and the one he just left is all he knows about but if he dies this lady shes gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has and i know hes all she has because she has him theres no– if she had one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say good morning gladys shed be like good and just flush him down the toilet just– poom poom the dog just keeps bumping on the drain poom  she gives up ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life ppp poommy daughter likes fishyou ever flush a pet down the toilet i had to flush my daughters fish down the toilet i came home the fish was dead she wasnt home from school yet so i just flushed the fish and thats a weird moment too cause fish live in water so you put it in the toilet floats to the bottom like yeah hes dead and then you flush and it looks like he goes wait a second aw shit i was taking a nap jesus you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house and then my daughter comes home why did he die da– come on what am i gonna say why did he die because who gives a shit thats the reason thats the actual reason is because didnt matter that he was alive thats why hes dead he didnt know his name and he didnt love you back these are the facts about that fishs life my daughter likes fish we took her to the aquarium i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston and we were looking at this seal or sea lion i dont know which one i dont care i dont think they need to be separate things i really dont they dont care and we dont care theres like three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say ok everybody from now on seals and sea lions and walruses and–you know what–penguins are all seals now and we would all be like yeah all right fine yes whatever man anyway so were looking at this sealsea lion thing and hes looking back at us through the plexiglas and hes going– theyre really disgusting in person most animals are when you really see them you ever go to a farm you think youre gonna see little white sheep going baa but theyre all fat and shitcolored and theyre like– jesus that thing is awful anyway seals dont go– they go– my daughters like what is he saying i dont know im a slave kill methe food chainmust be awful to be other kinds of stuff you know im glad im this this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives anything else any other kind of thing youre in the food chain youre in the food– we are out of the food chain i dont know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing life ends by being eaten thats how all life ends is– every single life except human life every life ends like this aah aah aah were the only ones that get to just die old in a bed just i love you bye i mean imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else imagine if we were in the food chain it would just be another thing you gotta deal with youre already having a bad day you wake in up in the morning youre making breakfast you burn your toast and its too late to try again and your kid comes in and says beh and youre like fine and its just why you get a thing in the mail that says that your phones different and your mortgage is another company now what i dont get it then youre walking to work like why do i even bother shit goddamn it theres always fucking cheetahs at the train station stop it you think that sharks– do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water i think theyd be bummed cause i dont think sharks are aware of that at all i think sharks think theyre slick they swim around like hey nobody has any idea whats down here and were all up here like theres totally a shark right there it wouldnt be fun being a predator either if youre a predator imagine if every time youre hungry you gotta chase a guy whos running for his life you gotta– come on dude shit get over here and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work that would really suck thats why animals just– they go lets do this together man you chase the parents away i am gonna eat the kid and you circle back thats why they do it like that fuck it im eating babies this is bullshit grownups aint worth the meat whoops all right all right shit goddamn it idiot this isnt a gay voice by the way its not shut up yeahcourtyard confrontationi live in new york city and its ok there i live in a nice building i never lived in a nice place before when i was growing up i had no money i mean my mom didnt didnt matter i was a child but im not used to it cause its nice theres like a pretty courtyard with flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing i dont know what is it with fountains like all fountain sculptors are pedophiles basically you cant get a fountain made without– can you make me a fountain yes ill get started right away yes yes its finished and its just little boys pissing on the face of a greek god that looks like him a lot just piss on me forever anyway theres one of those in the courtyard of my building and my first week in the building about a year ago i went down to the courtyard for the first time and i didnt look too good you know it was a sunday morning thats my least presentable hour theres a lot of you know just stains just like you know food and me and whatever and so im sitting there so shut up ha ha ha anyway but so there i was im sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place you know theres these fancy doormen and stuff and then theres this guy looking at me i notice hes looking at me from across the courtyard and hes all spiffylooking hes got brown shoes and hes looking at me like  i can tell he was thinking i dont live in the building he thinks i just wandered in off the streets and sat in the courtyard i can tell hes thinking of coming over and dealing with me on his own and im sitting there thinking like please do that yes please come on come on come on come on come on and im trying to look even more gross and im like pulling up my shirt  and then i see him go no thats not gonna do at all and he comes over to me  and im like num num num im so excited to have this thing a confrontation where im not wrong at all and he thinks i am rrgh so he comes over says excuse me do you live in this building and i said no cause why not start there i said no he goes well then what are you doing here and i said i just need to rest im having a hard time he says this is private property and i said well i dont really believe in that you know just the worst things i could say from his point of view is basically all the things i was saying and he goes well if you dont leave im gonna talk to the doorman i was like can i just stay like five more hours so hes–no and he goes over to the doorman and i see him talking about me to the doorman like this and then i see the doorman going no that guy lives here its ok and the look on his face– mwah mwah num num– it was just so– it was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion its like i had invented a new way to hurt somebodys feelings thats how excited i wasgetting what old isim  now so im either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a notsohealthy life i dont know which one i wont know till its over where this was i dont know how long im gonna live i dont know nobody knows i guess i think human life expectancy is pretty good we get a good run you know some people die early you know if i die now people will be like thats too bad if i die five years from now theyll be like well all right like its not even– its– like as soon as youre  youre a candidate you know theres no candlelight vigils for  guys that die and you start pushing– you know some people get to be like   you know there are people that get to like  and then theyre in the news and its always some old guy i met napoleon no you didnt you liar you oldest liar in the world but  you know youre not old yet but you start having moments where you kind of start getting what old is especially if you didnt take care of yourself you know i have moments where im like wow this seems early for this like this is something that happens to me a lot ill be sitting watching tv or doing nothing and all of a sudden ill realize i need to wipe my ass right now i mean nothing happened but i really gotta wipe my ass right now right now gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass how does this happen already im  already my assholes just like just–  my asshole– my assholes like the waistband on old pajama bottoms just kinda loose and ineffectual my assholes like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up its just sitting on the lawn full and open puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind some kid kicks it over on his way home from a tough day at middle school rats thats a pretty accurate description of my asshole heres another thing about my age right now if im– ok say im sitting down if im sitting anywhere which–ha ha ha– i love sitting so much– i would take sitting and doing nothing to standing and fucking any day this is way better than coming this is way better this is what– at my age if im sitting down and somebody tells me i need to get up and go to another room i need to be told all the information why first you gotta explain all that shit to me what why do i– no why though your car is being towed right now well thats what happens to me then thats– i accept that cause getting up is a whole thing it means first i have to decide do i really want to be alive anymore like lets start with that and then i gotta  start kind of rocking to get momentum  like im trying to get an old honda out of a snow bank shitputting on socksthe worst part of my day worst part of every day of my life is when i have to put on my socks putting on my socks is the worst part of every day and it always will be even if i have a terrible day in the future where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother if that ever happened to me the worst part of that day will be when i put on my socks because– putting on my socks that means i have to– heres what i have to do i have to get my hands past my pointed toe i dont even know how i do it im sitting here i dont know how i do that its cause you have to– its like folding a bowling ball in half soon as i start i can feel– im pushing all the fat up into my vital organs and i just feel all the systems failing beep beep beep and i have to like lay on my back like an eightyearold and go like this and i start passing out and i know other peoples lives are hard ha ha ha i know i saw an interview on tv with michael j fox and he has parkinsons and he was describing brushing his teeth and he said it takes him two hours a day and he said its agony and i saw this and i thought ok thats hard that is hard and so is putting on my socks sorry michael doesnt make it easier to know about your thing tell you what ill help you brush your teeth you help me with the socksif youre older youre smarteri dont know i like getting older though life is an education and if youre older youre smarter i just believe that if youre in an argument with somebody and theyre older than you you should listen to them it doesnt mean theyre right it means that even if theyre wrong their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have theyve been there longer if youre older youre smarter how many people here by applause are  or older  or older applaud ok thats about  people out of  heres the interesting thing theres way more i can see you theres so many more this is arizona there are way more people in that demographic but they didnt clap why cause theyre smart theyre sitting in the dark going i dont have to clap i dont have to do anything theyre not doing it and theyre right you know why cause never identify yourself never are you crazy you dont know why im asking how do you know what– ok burn them all burn everybody over  how do you know im not gonna do that how many people here by applause are  or younger  or younger applaud thats every time whoo whoo every time that is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where youre not the only people here thats like going to a cancer ward– not me whoo i dont have it i dont have it if youre older youre smarter a  garbage man is a million times smarter than a  with three phds especially smarter than him cause this idiot has been thinking about three things for like  years hes worthless the garbage man is  hes had some experience things have happened to him he went to cape cod one summer he saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool he took a bus to montreal he got a hand job at a fair from a miner i mean a miner not a minor a miner you understand a miner a grown man who works in a mine with dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair thats what im saying happened to the  you see hes had some experience he knows more more has happened to him hes seen more hes seen history hes witnessed history even if its not ancient history he saw nixon resign on live television me and those few people that clapped we saw the president of america cry and then quit being the president that shit was crazy cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next today people are like the presidents kind of disappointing really our president wept like an insane person and then got on a helicopter and flew away and the whole nation just watched him gogetting older makes my life betteri like getting older though because for me the kind of guy i am getting older makes my life better you know like my sex life way better at  look cause this situation is ok at  this is not a fun kind of a  to be and some people their life is better when theyre younger you know young dudes young skinny dudes best life in the world is being a young skinny dude they dont have to do anything they just show up with a big adams apple and a smelly tshirt hey im here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life so where do i– everywhere ok cool but for guys like me this is not a fun youth it gets better id like to make one of those it gets better ads for just dumpy young guys we could use a little help a little encouragement just somebody on tv listen man i know its tough right now youre vaguely heavy with no face you have zero value on the sexual marketplace you feel invisible to the girls in school because you are but it gets better because youll all grow up and you pretty much look just like this your whole life and they dont their options start running out really fast and youre gonna be there as long as you stay relatively employed and washed youre gonna be amazing in your  youre gonna be– youre gonna be the branch that she can grab before she hits the ground its gonna be so great it just takes time for her circumstances to match your looks but its gonna happen its gonna happen when real shit matters youre gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world its just time thats all it takes theres a formula to this its pussy plus time over income squaredeverybody has their timeeverybody has their time everybody has their time i mean not everybody there are people out there who theres just nobody for them yep people like to say things like theres someone for everyone nope not at all true and stop saying it cause its mean to people who never find anybody there are millions of people out there who weve all unanimously decided they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips even nobody touches their genitals their entire life they just wash it and then they die thats all that happens aww and if youre feeling bad for them you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart aww well go fuck one nah i didnt think so thats the one way were all mean nobody does that nobody fucks down nobody people fuck up or across some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up some guy yeah no you should im totally up yeahdating takes courageits a weird selection process that we have dating really is– its how we evolve is dating its how we choose each other and dating is a real drag for a lot of people but i always think its a nice thing you know when i see a date im always happy when i see a couple on a date cause it means people are still trying you know you see a couple on a date it means theres still courage out there that takes courage to go on a date for both sides two very different kinds of courage the male courage traditionally speaking is that he decided to ask he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if shes gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified everything in your body is telling you just go the fuck home and jerk off dont do this but he walked up and said hi yes and shes like  no no no a second give me a second and you try to get through this membrane of you know– and then if it works and you say you wanna go out sometime sometimes shell say yes and if she says yes thats her courage and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and illadvised and the whole species existence counts on them doing it and i dont know how they– how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men were the numberone threat to women globally and historically were the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to women were the worst thing that ever happens to them thats true you know what our numberone threat is heart disease thats the whole thing thats it just our own heart going dude i cant– you cant keep doing this i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart but women still– yeah ill go out with you alone at night what are you nuts ill get in your car with you with my little shoulders hi where are we going to your death statistically how do they still do it if youre a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and youre like i hope this ones nice i hope he doesnt do what hes going to dofirst datei always– i love when i see a date you know when you see a date you can tell its the first date cause of the way theyre walking together and shes looking up at his face trying to figure him out and hes just a mess a guy on a first date just has no actual personality hes just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each just anything no cohesive– just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines just you know well ha ha well yes i think so too ha ha rrgh whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date thats later down the line and something has happened theres something that happens in a date that i never get to witness cause women do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly im gonna let him fuck me they just get to decide something he says and shes like that was good hes gonna fuck me later and he has no idea hes still like trying all this shit he still has no idea hes already in theretitsguys are– we love women a lot– all men do– and we just look at you thats what i do i just look at women i just– like theyre you know cakes in windows i just– i was walking in new york once and theres these two very cute women walking behind me and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other you know cause they were cute so i wanted to hear them like thats gonna help me in any way to hear their– dont you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for like one second ok here here i go thank you its really a flaw in men that we would all do that if youre a woman you could ask any guy on planet earth could you squeeze my tit for one second and  of us will go yes of course that doesnt matter i could be doing open heart surgery yeah ok beep dont worry hes not your tits dont worry about it i dont know why we love tits so much some people say its because we breastfeed but so do women or you know baby women not grownup women dont usually– you dont see like a  woman like a stately look– you know like sigourney weaver like sucking milk out of a young womans tit thank you deborah ill see you tomorrow at  its not usually the thing is the elderly breastfeeding from the young except for at the end of the grapes of wrath which i dont mean to ruin that book for you but you should have read it by now i dont know if you read the grapes of wrath but thats how it ends with an old dying man sucking milk out of a young girls tits and then the book is over and youre like jesus what happened at the end there thats crazy theres no other book in that genre theres no dense historic classic that ends with a weird porny paragraph at the very– and then anna karenina shat on his chest holy moly with that the end my god that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book ive been reading this book for three months but we do we love tits and you always know a tit you always know a tit you know like you ever been in a crowded place– like a subway or like you know a sports stadium– and youre smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you youre like thats a tit i just touched it i know that was a tit i know it because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable just to tits cause you could drive a tack in there im not gonna feel it but a tit– through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket sweater shirt and bra somehow its a tit i touched a tit i touched a tit i touched one tit one tit thats rare to touch one tit its like a fourleaf clover usually you touch two the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didnt have permission but otherwise when tit access is granted its usually good for two tits at a time its once youre on one– you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didnt get the second one yeah its like your moms dirty whore tit why what i said i liked it thats what i meant is that i like it i like your moms dirty whore tit and i like yours and if its up to the guy were gonna touch both tits no guy touches a tit and then goes you know what im good with the one thats fine for me everything in moderation were gonna touch both even if something terrible happens in the middle of– yeah– theres a bomb shit come on lets get– come on lets get your tits out of heredivorceive seen a few tits ive seen–i dont know–  maybe i dont know i had my history in my life you know ive been divorced for five years and its been the best part of my life being divorced easily my favorite part of my life i love being divorced every year has been better than the last that is the only time i can say that about and by the way im not saying dont get married if you meet somebody fall in love and get married and then get divorced because thats the best part its the best part marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness which is divorce because you just let go and everythings fine now divorce is forever it really actually is marriage is for how long you can hack it but divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak nobody ever says  my divorce is falling apart its over i cant take it and again if youre in a good marriage stay in it if youre in the best marriage ever stay in it im just saying if you got out it would be better thats just a fact im sorry im sorry but its true everythings better my exwife and i this is the best part of our knowing each other were good coparents because we live apart and were friends

dancing and every parent is standing there like this every single person was blocking their vision of their actual child with their phone and the kids– i went over by the stage and the kids– theres people holding ipads in front of their faces it looked like were all in the witness protection program like the kids cant see their parents and everybodys watching a shitty movie of something thats happening ten feet– like look at your fucking kid the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look its totally hd why are you taping this youre never gonna watch it in a million years youre not gonna watch videos of your kids doing shit you missed the first time it happened you dont watch it you just put it on facebook here you watch it i wanna take a nap now and then you get to read all

facebook everybody will write the same thing thats adorable i think i see a future starlife is a good dealdont tape shit on your– life is short life is very short i like life i like it i feel like even if it ends up being short i got lucky to have it cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life if you have a life thats an ama– heres your boilerplate deal with life this is basic cable what you get when you get life you get to be on earth first of all–my god– what a location this is earth and for trillions of miles in every direction it fucking sucks so bad its so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head cause it sucks so bad you get to be on earth and look at shit as long as youre not blind or whatever it is you get to be here you get to eat food you get to put bacon in your mouth i mean when you have bacon in your mouth it doesnt matter whos president or anything you just– every time im eating bacon i think i could die right now and i mean it thats how good life is you get to– you get to fuck thats free if youre smart that comes with thats part of the deal where else are you gonna get that deal you get to put your dick in there and go in and out pretty good and if youre a woman you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want anytime you want if youre a gay man you get to just fill your boyfriends ass with your dick just fill it all the way to the balls and its nice and warm and tight in there and hes your buddy if youre a lesbian you get to do all the stuff theyre doing and its a great deal you get to eat you get to fuck you get to read to kill a mockingbird its a great life so you know im not worried about it endingbehind the wheelits pretty good and ive wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i dont know you know its amazing how nasty we can get as people depending on the situation like most people are ok as long as theyre ok but if you put people in certain contexts they just change like when im in my car i have a different set of values i am the worst person i can be when im behind the wheel which is when im at my most dangerous when youre driving thats when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons and yet its the worst people get and i am the worst one time i was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and he kind of–i dont know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second and this came out of my mouth i said worthless piece of shit i mean what an indictment what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being worthless piece of shit thats somebodys son and things ive said to other people i was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did– i dont remember even– and i yelled out my window i said hey fuck you where outside of a car is that even nearly ok if you were in an elevator and you were like right next to a persons body and whatever like he leaned into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go hey fuck you worthless piece of shit no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you theres nothing you would not say to them i hope you die i said that to a person i hope you die why cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life you tested my reflexes and it worked out fine so now i hope your kids grow up motherless i mean what am i capable of id like to think that im a nice person but i dont know manif murder was legala lot of it is context theres a lot of things i wonder if the world was different like if murder was legal i might have killed a few people i dont know id love to think i would never do that but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder is the numberone thing preventing murder wed like to think its cause like i would never do that no its cause it really sucks getting caught murdering a lot if murder was legal or just a misdemeanor– like you get a thing in the mail– shit they had a camera there well if murder was legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderers would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you wouldnt trust somebody who didnt murder if murder was legal you wouldnt like them i never killed anybody ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep i mean not even a hooker live a life whats wrong with that guy hes like a mormon or some shit i hate those guys i think hes nice shut up janet they would just– if murder was legal there would be a lot of murder children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids thats mostly what would happen if murder was legal you know youd go to a mall thered be like eight different moms in the mall just– i told you to stop it you didnt listen to me just–pbbt thered be just– youd be stepping over dead kids thered be like a new problem you have to clean up your kids when you kill them cause its gross its bad for the environment if you murder your child in a public place please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers every three feet of america put your murdered child in the red bag with a logo of a murdered kid on it next to the other logo that tells you not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave them in the bag that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row right in a row that is a compressed area of bad thoughtof course but maybeyou know you have your bad thoughts hopefully you do good things everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts hopefully the good thoughts win for me i always have both i have like the thing i believe the good thing– thats the thing i believe– and then theres this thing and i dont believe it but it is there its always this thing and then this thing its become a category in my brain that i call of course but maybe ill give you an example ok like of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected of course we have to segregate their food from nuts have their medication available at all times and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies of course but maybe maybe if touching a nut kills you youre supposed to die of course not of course not of course not jesus i have a nephew who has that id be devastated if something happened to him but maybe maybe if we all just do this for one year were done with nut allergies forever no of course not of course if youre fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt its a terrible tragedy of course of course but maybe maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot its not that weird maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at its a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened listen listen you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts for kids dying from nuts you applauded so youre in this with me now do you understand you dont get to cherrypick those kids did nothing to you of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened of course it is every time its happened– black people in america jews in egypt every time a whole race of people has been enslaved its a terrible horrible thing of course but maybe maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves every single thing where you go how did they build those pyramids they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just threw chinese people in caves and blew em up and didnt give a shit what happened to them theres no end to what you can do when you dont give a fuck about particular people you can do anything thats where human greatness comes from is that were shitty people that we fuck others over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where theyre making these they jump off the fucking roof cause its a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candles and horses and be a little

a honest insight into his personal experiences over his life of tumultuous relationships				 wow hey thank you thanks thank you guys hey seattle nice to see you look at this look at us were here this is crazy its insane so about five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i dont really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person im arguing with and the reason its a source of tension is that im right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes well you dont believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people and i was like no i think its insane you know for anyone and she said whyand i said well first of all it just seems doomed you know  of marriages end in divorce thats just first marriages by the way second marriages  to  end in divorce third marriages  to  end in divorce thats a learning curvesecond of all monogamys impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when i say that i think people assume that im implying that men are incapable of being faithful i think women are just as incapable but for more sophisticated reasons you know i mean with men were just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when i say that my female friends are like well we like sex just as much as you do and i said sure but its different and they say how and i say have you ever masturbated while driving a carnumber three im never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think thats not brought up often enough i um i didnt know that would be the reaction oh no thats the hopeful partthe uh i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and hes a comedian as well not only did we decide we werent gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it like we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages you know we were we were pretty good i mean we werent like the best in the world im sure there are better in europe but we were we were solid you know like so like for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said are you sure this is what you want to do and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we werent friends anymoreso february   im at andys house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause hes the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youre right he says stuff like she sounds crazy like even if what shes saying isnt that crazy like youd be like she only eats whole wheat bagels hed be like she sounds crazy youd be like thats not even the crazy part you know so im telling him about his argument and he goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and im driving out of andys small road and im tboned i dont know if youre familiar with this term uh this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car drivers side at a  angle like a tbone steak and in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i knowlet me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i uh no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was like scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times ill write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes what are you doing and i said im writing my set list and then she goes i think itll be fine and i was like no it wont be fine and then she was like i think it will be okay and i said why do you think that and she said well you look so nervous i think theyll feel sorry for you but jenny has this really soft sweet voice like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said it seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage normally id be offended by that but in this instance i was like you are right that is a great point you are beautiful you know she re she really was you know from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me uh i mean i mean that in like in the most meaningful way like that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i id jus id just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and and then we werent and then when we werent i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely you know and but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didnt i didnt think it was gonna happenlike i dont have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if im seeing a girl shed think id have sex with him maybe you know and im im not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just dont give off a great first impression like ill give you an example like this is the shirt i decided to wear tonight like i didnt i didnt spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt i mean this is my a outfit my b outfit was naked i like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that i might be a fixerupper ive reached this point in my life i dont really look in the mirror before i leave my apartment i glance at it to make sure im not bleeding you know what i mean like but i dont stare at the mirror if i stare at the mirror i get angry like i feel like im complaining about a bad call a ref just made im like come on youre blind if youre leaving the house like that and the ref is god and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline and its a close game cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast and im all riled up im about to charge the field and the guy comes by with fried dough and im like next time you know thats how i go for fried dough cause i have a problem i justthis is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second im gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so ive been going uh recently to a womens exercise class iive given up on having a traditional male physique and so now im going for strong independent woman and uh its going pretty well you know im not as good in the class as you might think sometimes ill kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnt looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though ive been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics you know how they do gymnastics how theyll have those the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while and im not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes theyll fall and its ugly cause theyre rolling around like im in a lot of trouble like i dont even know how i got here but at the end of that no matter what and i totally fall for it im like that cant possibly be the same loser from moments ago i mean thats a completely different person this person has much better posture for startersi really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i dont know and uh i didnt have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and uh pfft which yeah i dont know if that was the best idea cause uh were heading were in the car heading to the pub and jenny says oh i left my id at the hotel and i was like oh we can just swing back and get it and shes like shes like no itll be fine i was like no it wont be fine cause its st patricks day and theres bouncers and she goes no itll be okay and i was like no it wont be okay and then we get to the pub and it was fine like the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are like prison guards and for jenny theyre like birthday clowns like you know what can i do to make your day betteryou know and thats were at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasnt the idea and so i said i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on like the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but uh but she warmed to me as the night went on cause she was drinking and then like no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says sure we get to her door and i didnt want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says oh no thank you which i thought was polite but disappointing i mean theres something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youre really putting yourself out there youre just like i think we should connect mouths you know and the other persons like i do not think we should connect mouths and those are theyre two very different mouth agendas you know and then you just feel so stupid youre like i never should have suggested we connect mouths you knowthis is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses like i i remember growing up like when people started making out like in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember i remember it like it was yesterday cause i was shocked i was like people we know are just making out with other people we know but how you know it seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was like i am not doing that and collectively all the girls in my class were like that is fine you are not on the list youre not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity i was like perfect it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of like sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like i dont like when i see two dudes making out in the street and i feel that way about anyone like making out is just sloppy its like watching a dog eat spaghetti thats how i make out is that right does anybody know if thats right okay goodso in seventh grade i was like im not gonna make out with anybody and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was like the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned like we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order first order of business nintendo second order of business why doesnt anyone like us meeting adjourned i dont know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was like i got to try to get into the makeout club but it was a very intangible goal i didnt really talk to a lot of girls and there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league like she had many suitors she had i dont the rest of the show is in old english uh she doth had many suitors uh no she had many you know admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was like oh this is great i got to do that more and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well cause she goes mike you got to stop im gonna pee myself and i was like wow this was the closest id ever come to a vagina so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and thats how i ended up here yeah thats how we all ended up here in a senseso uh so heres what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldnt believe it like all of a sudden i thought well maybe this will be like one of those romantic comedy montages well go to the carnival well get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel well make out itll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song but i think that when youre  years old you just dont understand certain things about your digestive system you dont know that you shouldnt eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items its basically saying were gonna take sugar which everyone knows is bad but then well dress it up like insulation and im like im not sure what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation theyre like we already sold it im like well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates i dont know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the shits of pantserator and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said they said we like it but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy says well what about the i think im gonna dieerator and theyre like thats good cause it gets across the essence of how you feel when youre on the machine plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea which is a nice homage to the original intention of the machine but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy goes well what about the scrambler cause it scrambles you theyre like we get it frank but who frank is a maniac this guy cant be stopped but every once in a while hes got a good idea but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment and this one guy goes well i have a nephew whos  years old and smokes pot  hours a day i feel like he might be available and theyre like he sounds amazing we dont even need to interview him he sounds completely qualifiedi sit down with lisa on the scrambler and im feeling good like shes snuggling up close to me and im thinking im thinking like this could be it this could be where its all gonna happen this is very special and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment its not a ralph nader approved item i dont think its saved lives i think the only thing its ever done is in a scrambler accident its just sort of held someones esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident dont talk about scrambler accident thats from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the  stoner i was like hey actually and then he was gone apparently he doesnt enjoy the second halves of sentencesso then im scrambling and as i am scrambling im thinking i need to come up with a plan of some kind im not going down without a fight my first plan was very simple it was just dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i was like dont look at lisa dont look at any other people dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i need a new plan and the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator that he needed to stop the ride but the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so im like i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride please stop the ride and im back im not sure he heard me i got to say it louder please stop the ride im not sure hes paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now the third time i said please stop and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just popcorn peanuts insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but im pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that eveningtwo years later it gets worse um im at the st johns high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st johns gymnasium like cattle which is a friendly way to describe women you know so cattle shows up at  well make out with the cattle cattle goes home at  then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just like this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss cause it was like this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask like oh have you had your first kiss id be like yeah like all the time like every every week i always feared at some point thered be a followup question like oh yeah whats it like and id be like yeah you know its just like licking an ice cream cone and theyd be like no its not its like sucking on a rocket pop and id be like ah wrong frozen dessert analogy im at the dance and im flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and were introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were like moo and we were like moo and then sam says one of these phrases i think weve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says you get that one which i know its the worst turn of phrase but im comfortable saying it cause i know ive been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me you get that one and then her friend goes like oof you know or even worse or even worse like you owe me which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someones credit score you know so he goes he goes you get that one and then im just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mcs bust a move and im not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so its only catching me one out of every five hey so shes losing interest but at  the speed and then im saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long whats great about slow dancing is you cant really mess it up cause its just sort of a slowmotion hug like the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it shed be like what are you doing and id be like i dont pick up on social cues you know but its such a long song you know stairway so im just trying not to fidget im sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didnt know anything about making out but id seen people do it i could see theres like a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was like some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no you know theres no video documentation of that area its like the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive theyve only seen it washed up on the shore which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but so im trying not to fidget then with   minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was like oh no i dont want to be alone anymore and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then its an allout mouth war and she had artillery cause she had braces it was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is im not alone anymore im not in the nonmakeout club and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldnt because up until that point id lied and said that id had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was like howd it go dude i had to be like same as always pretty smoothas the week wore on i started to convince myself well maybe it did go well and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind but i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief you know we didnt have a lot to talk about i remember just being like hey you like full house me neither cool all right later you know what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from her kind of like why are you calling me and i remember thinking oh im probably reading into that one too much and and then she stopped calling me back and i was like oh yeah i read into that one perfectly but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldnt even tell my friends until one day i was i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was like hey whats going on with sandra like she hasnt called me back and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was like what tom was like nothing and i was like what tom was like nothing and i was like what toms like oh i talked to sandra and she said youre the worst kisser shes ever kissed and it was so devastating cause not only was it probably true but i couldnt explain to my friends why it was true i couldnt say that makes sense ive never done that before so instead i had to play it off i had to be like yeah that sounds about right im a terrible kisser thats kind of my thingso i lean in to kiss jenny and she says oh no thank you she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be jen irish pub nice a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldnt afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card were out to dinner and she says to me she goes everyone hates me at work and i said why would they hate you i love you she goes you love me i go i mean you seem cool i pulled it back i didnt want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said you know sometimes ill date two people at once and that way im never let down by either person i said that seems like a really smart plan like id like to do that as well and she said im still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if youre seeing them and i was like all right sounds like a plan got it break i got to go find some more people you know and so a few nights later im in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later im out to dinner with jenny and she says how was your trip and i said it was great i did some shows and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl and that didnt go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was like but im right about that right like im supposed to tell you if that happens right and she says yeah but it doesnt mean that i wont lose interest in you and i said thats a whole new clause thats a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects i said are you still seeing john and she said sometimes i said well dont you see the contradiction in that and she says yes and it gets very quiet because we were falling in lovethree weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didnt have a lot left we went to bermuda cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when its winter in new york it is also winter in bermuda and uh jenny and i meet up at the airport and shes late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler im always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and and jennys late and then we get to security and im not making this up she doesnt have a license or a passport and i said what do you mean i go how do you travel and she goes well usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id i dont like to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just cant imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things like this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because theyre just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and you know the women wouldnt want that unless theyre lesbians although theres an idea you know alqaeda alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although then theyd have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds you know all  virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as like a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity like the  virgins are like i didnt even know i was a lesbian until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist and now thats all im into i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy theyd die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me and  of my friends but now i dont see khalid in the same way anymorethe point is we went to bermuda and were on the flight on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says congratulations on your honeymoon and we said oh no thanks were not on our honeymoon and she walks away and jenny says thats so funny i dont think ill ever go on a honeymoon and i said oh really and she goes yeah i dont think id ever want to get married in my life and i said oh really i go me too i said is that based on a principle or did you have a bad relationship like what was your first boyfriend like and she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was they were at the same bus stop when they were  and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they you know their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said then what and she said he died he had leukemia and i said well do you ever talk about this with anyone and she says no i dont really like to talk about it but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night wed be up till  or  in the morning and we were so happy we at one point i was like well we should do this again we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport jenny said that sounds great but i dont think id get a license or a passport cause they dont make me get one and i was like yeah but its the law you know jenny says yeah i dont think ill get one cause they dont make me get one you know thats how i feel thats how jenny argues things sometimes shell just say thats how i feel and ill say thats not an argument like were not even in an argument right now because you dont have an argument and shell say i just won that argument and ill say thats not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is and shell say i just won that argument again thats how i feelyou could see how this could be a little bit maddening you know uh on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said we should play and i was like yeah but not like a game and she said why and i said well cause id win and she said no i think i would win i go no i know that id win and i know that what im supposed to say is that the guy says ill win the girl says ill win and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just dont have that in me and jenny goes you dont have to let me win lets go out and play and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just like it was just like  to  you know  to  i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said ive never met someone whos so obsessed with the score and i said the score is what makes it a gameso were arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then were still arguing about it at  or  in the morning about essentially nothing and she said i dont understand why youre so obsessed with being right i go im not obsessed with it i just am i said why do you think youre right and she says thats how i feel i said if you think im so wrong about everything why are you even with me and jenny says you cant choose who you love which is true but it doesnt mean its good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and youre just like this is it i found her im  years old and im done you know and her name was amanda and she was like adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was like a delinquent like i was like this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality like at one point she was like it was totally messed up because it wasnt even me it was this other girl and i was framed and i was just like awesome like no one would ever frame me for anything i just i thought it was like an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was like to be cool at one point i was like do you want to write an article for the newspaper she goes i dont want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about and i was like good answeri find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back shed be like no one likes you at all only kidding or like youre like a nerd but youre not even smart just joking cant choose who you lovesecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i dont i dont mean that in an offensive way like lying was kind of like a its like a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar youd know when he was lying cause he would lick his finger like a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and hed go yeah yeah nice nice you know and he wasnt even handling money like i dont even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant hed be like yeah my uncles tony robbins motivational speaker yeah nice you know and we found out that that wasnt even true but even if that were true that wouldnt be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think thats the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when youre lying about big stuff its like bankingthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know im in the future also i think we can all see now cause were so smart and mikes so dumb and uh you know i can also see in retrospect thats a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she had another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that you know i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought well this is the affirmation that i need im gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend and i drive my moms station wagon to amandas parents house and i walk in the front door and theres amanda and theres her parents and its going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott im assuming hes like a family friend or a relative and slowly im noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend theyre both in their first year in college and theyre competitive wrestlers and its dawning on me that im hanging out with my girlfriends boyfriend and its going pretty well i mean he he seemed like a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say i wish it were just you and me here and i remember thinking you could make that happen the way she said it was as though she werent involved in the decision process like id love to but the boys in corporatewell the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriends boyfriends parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression you know youre like maybe if this goes well shell see that im good with adults in general as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me how do you know amanda and i said were just friends from school and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking i am never gonna let this happen to me againso ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful cause it was in texas and i thats thats not to say i dislike texas entirely its such a large thing to dislike and uh but that week it felt like texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy i love comedy clubs cause theyre sort of a highlow entertainment proposition like in some ways though theyre the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws you know like theres  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and theyre handing out gummy penises or whatever thats thats actually a thing i didnt even realize that i didnt realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was was the gummy quality of the penis i feel like if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i but thats thats not my job im you know i leave that to the experts but i just i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and id been drinking all week and uh i always try to be a team player you know so i was like whatever i can do to help i dont see how this could end badly and uh the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and im hung over and im groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight im still two hours early and i land in new york and i get a cab to jennys parents house and i walk in the front door and theres jenny and theres her parents and theres her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasnt front and center like he was just kind of around like he was in the pool like wading and doing laps like that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was like well whats john doing here and she says well he and i arent still together but when we were together he became friends with my stepdad and hes been staying here at their house the last couple weeks and i said you know thats not good i feel like that gives him the edge jennys staring at me and i said what she says you have a hickey on your neck and i said i dont think thats true and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say im really sorry and she says where is that from and i said there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk that sentence never comes out right i mean theres no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay and we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didnt have a leg to stand on i was like well what about john what was he doing there she said you have a hickey on your neck i said yeah but at least i told you the truth and she said eventually and i said eventually is better than never and then she kneed me in the balls i dont know if youve ever experienced this before im sure half of you have not uh its like being electrocuted except you dont get to die its like you want to die but you cant and theres a person in your face saying you deserve this which they wouldnt even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane  even in texasjenny says i think that we should just break up you know its not just this i mean youre away a lot of the time and even when youre here you work at night and i work in the day i just dont think its gonna work out and i said okay  and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while id get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen irish pub nice and it would just say hi and id write back hi it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new years i caved in and i called her i said hey i really miss you and i want to see you and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just like we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there you know i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was like the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said what and she says i think that we should live together and i said no i really dont think thats a good idea you know ive just decided you know as a principle im not gonna get married or live with someone its not personal and she said well unless we live together i just dont think its gonna work out cause we just dont see each other enough and i dont think that we stand a chance thats how i feelso we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said oh no thanks that doesnt go over so well she says why and i said well as you know i dont believe in marriage and so i dont buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it she said well what do you believe in and i said i dont know she said well if you dont believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage and i said well first of all you know it just doesnt seem necessary i mean is it you know marriage is an archaic institution invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property i dont want to be a part of that second of all i dont even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is i mean one of me and andys friends was about to get engaged and we were skeptical and we said are you sure this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life and he goes yeah i think so and we said well what if she gets in a car accident and shes disfigured would you stay with her then and he said maybe that is not an acceptable answer third of all if im so in love why does it need to be written into a government contract and im not one of these like i dont want government up in my business kind of people i think the government does a nice job delivering the mail and suggesting i dont eat poison but i just dont understand why they need to be involved in my personal relationships then finally if marriage is religious shouldnt i believe in the religion ive been to more weddings of my friends where the people on the altar dont believe in the religion of the church theyve invited us to some of them even go to classes with the priest in advance to more elaborately lie about believing in a religion they dont believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building that is insane thats how i feel so i explain this to jenny and jenny says well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you and i said why arent you listening to any of this and jenny says thats how i feelat this point it was  in the morning wed been arguing all night and we hadnt slept i had to catch a flight at  am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point im overtired and im angry and im late im stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment its  am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isnt even there theres a guy with a laptop going we need a road stat whats the code for building tank you know and i get to the airport the news hasnt even started yet its just an anchor looking around like what are you up to and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes well that aint your gate like i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was like i was not involved in this process i wasnt even ccd like as though i had gone to the kiosk and been like  like hell im flying out of  and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been like this is where im going you know im not that aggressive as a traveler so i was like well where is this gate she goes its in another terminal you got to take a tram she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say and you better run like i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was like i dont want to run i have wheels and i was like i dont want to run either but this is what we have to do i tell you what when we get to the hotel ill walk you in circles for a few hours then i i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was like perfect thats exactly how long i want to wait but the trams riding away i was like thats  minute then it says ten minutes and im experiencing that psychological downward spiral like oh great im gonna miss my flight and then im gonna miss every flight from now on and im gonna miss my family reunion and then im not gonna have a family and then im gonna be a crack whore and its like all of a sudden im a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time andi get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and im sweaty and im out of breath but im on time and im so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally id be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady im a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think thats an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was like do you know these people she was like all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy i was like drew barrymores character come back she didnt come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas you know how i feel about texas and uh i get to los angeles late that night and id missed my show id never missed one of my shows before and im so angry and jennys calling me but im not picking up the phone cause im blaming this entire day on heri get back to my friend andys house and i said andy this relationship is messing up my entire life and andy goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning i drive out of andys small road and im tboned thats the culinary way of describing it in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away  minutes later im sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri have arrived as well as my friend andy and thats when i start crying you know how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesnt doesnt start crying right away because it doesnt understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then its like oh i guess i should be doing something that matches that waah im crying because im looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist like i said earlier i dont really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things id experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and the officer comes over and he says what happened and i said i got hit by this car and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i cant help but think thats karma thats a hit and run and hit and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes sign this and i said well what does it mean and he goes it means youre okay and that we can leave i was really shaken up i was like i dont know if im okay and he goes just sign it which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that youve just said no to and its unattractive but very effective you know i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours cause the other driver had beat us there and eventually were with the doctor and andy says to him he goes well was the other guy drunk and the doctor says well i cant answer that and andy says was he he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works you know the doctor says well hes heading to jail now and andy and i flash each other a look like the hardy boys like case closed a few hours later were back at andys house its probably around  in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married and andy says mike sleep on it and i said no no no this makes perfect sense and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says mike sleep on it he saves methe next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed and im not making this up  for the repairs on the other drivers mercedes suv and i was like well this cant be happening i explained to the woman i think its a misunderstanding the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault and she said im really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money so i requested the accident report and im gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i dont know if youve ever seen one of these things before but its a little bit like homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says  thats me started to go but all of a sudden  thats me also came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now im pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other drivers statement at the scene of the accident was i was on venice going uh im not too sure i was going away from the beach i was driving i dont know what happened did i hurt anyone i dont know where i was going but i came from home i had a sip of beer which is really everyones favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right thats what they serve these days at the homebeachpubso all of its mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so im like i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know cause im calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows im trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and im so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car i know and i mean thats what i said i go arent you listening to any of this i go and this guy was clearly drunk i mean he nearly killed me inches from where he hit and i would be dead right now and he wants me to pay for his car dont you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and its just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law im on the phone with lawyers and private investigators theres only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no and he says did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no this isnt about money and he doesnt take the case and this is when i start going completely madim up to about  or  am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have  so now i know this guys name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller like jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia i was like im gonna track down jim bosworth im gonna sue jim bosworth and im gonna sue the entire los angeles police department at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me like hey whats going on id be like ill tell you whats going on id tell them this whole story and theyd be like you should get a lawyer id be like this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldnt even touch this cause he wouldntthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and shes talking to me but im not listening cause im writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin ive drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers im gonna call that week and im so angry im writing over my own handwriting to the point where im ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says what are you doing and i said well this is my case and she says well why dont you work on that in the morning and i said well which part of this napkin dont you understand jenny says mike youre right but its only hurting you and im just so glad that youre alive and i think that we should focus on that she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guys car july   jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didnt believe in the idea of marriage and i still dont but i believe in her and ive given up on the idea of being rightthank you guys very much thank you thank you guys so much thanks for coming here tonight and joining memoremike birbiglia standup transcripts share this article

divide you feel the division you know and its so much closer than you think like i dont believe in the south everyone thinks thats where theres a different point of view no the south is  minutes from wherever you think isnt the south like i had a show in upstate new york i got in this dudes car just magad out i was in the south i went north but i was south and i could tell i was scared cause my

walks into congress the republicans are just like gay youre like guys you cant say it like that anymore but yeah i mean remember we used to say gay in sixth grade it did not mean homosexual it just meant gay and he is sixth grade gay for sure hes our first gay president i think its beautiful its very beautiful to see a gay man lead i hate the way gay people are being used now too theyre trying to divide us theyre using everyones identity like the whole world has seen right like all this bombing is happening and it always boils down to some random thing where theyll be like do you think hamas likes gay people and my gay friends dont fall for it it–like cause it makes no sense its like so you think everyone youre bombing is just straight like all of gazas straight like theres not one gayzan and–and this country doesnt even care about gay people they started caring like three years ago when trans people scared them into it half the country was like can we just get regular gay or we miss them i dont fall for any of it they love dividing us letting us just fight while they figure out their stuff so i have this in my head as muhammads pitching me he goes ramy dude were looking at this map its a crazy map brother weve got all these battleground states we dont know which ones were gonna win but weve realized if we can win just one well get the whole country the only state we

being drawn theyre trying to tell me im supposed to have a problem with jewish people they throw this whole thing– muslimjewish holy war im like i dont know what youre talking about when i grew up my best friends were jewish i grew up in a town there were two muslim families three jewish families and we were bound by that– that christmaslessness you know that feeling you know when you just know the truth like everyones like santas coming youre like dude no hes not like what that fuck thats a capitalist lie youre a fucking corporate pig its so hard not doing christmas in this country its like you just dont get to have an imagination its so hard as a muslim like its the biggest temptation i have do you have any idea how much i want a christmas tree but i dont do it i dont do it for god any muslims here with a christmas treei dont know how you explain that to god thats a crazy sin like if you drank at the bar today hed be like all right peer pressure but you brought a tree into your house thats wild like that–that messes up the environment theres so many steps to that thats a premeditated sin no we never had christmas trees i didnt my jewish friends didnt and–and then when i got older i loved dating jewish girls i–i did ill be honest i dont anymore cause im married now so yeahthank you uh my wife is from saudi arabia  yeahno dont–no no i heard it i heard the saudi silence even the muslims in the room are like why didnt you marry the–the jewish girls that–that would have been– that would have made more sense just like people of the book you know were its so crazy too cause her– her familys so sweet theyre amazing like they found out about us they came over her dad had questions for me i had questions for him he was like what are your intentions with my daughter i was like what happened to jamal khashoggi and and he told me he told me and its–its a total misunderstanding like its not even what you think–what you thought ok if you dont know jamal khashoggi was a journalist who was brutally murdered what happened to him was absolutely inhumane and my wife had nothing to do with it and i know because i asked her i still ask her like i–i still– cause anyone whos married knows it takes a really long time to get to know somebody right it takes an even longer time to get to know what they know about jamal khashoggi and i dont want her like canned answer you know cause people dont talk anymore like theres just talking points so i try to catch her when shes vulnerable like when i know shes not gonna be ready really vulnerable moments right like—like when shes driving you know its new for her and it is she didnt grow up doing it she–she hates merging so like well be going on the highway and ill be like what happened to khashoggi and shes like what the fuck like im like what is that is that–you know something or is that the merge or like middle of the night you know youre like cuddling with your girl you just like get up in her ear and im just like khashoggi tell me the truth what happened to khashoggi wheres the body just like a little foreplay and shes like what are you doing what are you doing stop i dont know anything she doesnt know and my friends are so scared one of my friends was like i cant believe her familys still there we need to save them lets start a kickstarter to get them out and i was like i mean they would donate more than anybody they–they dont need the money but she was like but her mother how could she be there the way they treat women and this was like one month after roe v wade remember when we were just like wade won and i go to her you know that you can get an abortion in saudi anywhere the whole country i mean she started looking up flights like she couldnt believe it my friends couldnt believe it and so when they see her its like you know theyre– theyre learning something new thats whats beautiful sometimes about dating someone different you learn something new so i loved dating jewish girls cause every time i did i was always like yo lets solve it tonight like fuck the un its you and me we can do this you ever so horny youre like i could figure out palestinei was on a date with this girl right we go to her house shes got roommates she told me but you know the roommate house you know you walk in theres just shoes its like the shoe section at the mosque its like wet flipflops– like everything we go in her room its dark i cant see anything were in there for a few minutes you know haram she gets up to go to the bathroom as she leaves she turns on the light this is the first time im seeing the room and right in front of me on the wall is a huge flag of israel and im scared the only thing that wouldve scared me more is an american flag can you imagine seeing an american flag inside thats crazy that belongs outside when its inside i go outside that flag needs sun and wind it cant just be fucking hanging out under an led like no i dont want to see any flag inside no country the muslim countries theyre crazy they dont do anything no no–like unless youre hispanic i–that flag if i see any of those im just like i hope your soccer teams doing well im really rooting for you you know like i dont even think they have armies i think they just play soccer if you win you get the oil like that feels like the stakes when im watching like this must be about oil theyre way too passionate about this so im in there im looking at this flag and im horny so im trying to justify it like im looking at it and im like she– she told me she was jewish this is just– its the star of david thats their logo its just jewish but big like what if she doesnt know and then im like she probably knows all right so im like ok when she comes back were gonna talk about it and im ready you know when you know youre about to get into that conversation like you know like im always excited like i want to defend and im ready but then theres this part of my brain thats like fuck like i wish i read more you know cause ill always be in these arguments and like people have facts and i just have vibes theyll be like in –dadadada and im just like bro the vibe is off like look at this picture like what the–what are you talking aboutthe problem is i dont know how to read im not even saying that– i straight up dont know like every time i read the only thing i can think about is the fact that im reading do you ever feel that like—like ill read a page and my brain isnt taking in the information im just so proud three pages in all im thinking is yo i read dude im a book guy fuck dude im so smart its so wild like my friends are dumb its weird theyre just on tiktok i read its wild i gotta show them what im doing i take out my phone i take a picture of like a good paragraph right page six start sending it to all the boys im like boys time to read we gotta read dude like its just–its– its an ancient art form and then i fall asleep every single time every single time i read i fall asleep without brushing my teeth and i have three cavities just unfinished books sitting in my mouth ive–ive never been able to read biggest lie i ever told as a kid was about reading you know that lie you tell that like makes you a liar ill–ill never forget this i–we had a book report i picked gandhi big it was like a  bookeven the teacher was like dude i dont– i dont think you can do this i had a month to read and write the thing i started reading the book the night before its due and i think i can do it you know that–that– like you get home at  youre like i got this  pm youre like no problem  fine the second it hits  pm double digits the walls start closing in and im panicking and im like fuck i needed a month so i had the first few pages right theyre me like i wrote them theyre mine in my mind im like yo theres no way this teacher is gonna like read this whole thing hes got so many students hes just gonna figure out whats going on up top so ill just make it long and then he wont knowso i start violently copypasting from all over the internet i mean its crazy some of these paragraphs have links one of them ends with buy at barnes and noble today but i make it big and then i put it in the plastic remember the plastic binding yo i walk in the next day im looking at all these reports nobodys got plastic i start talking shit im like this is crazy look at all these naked book reports i hand mine to the teacher im like check this out look i put a–look i put a little hijab on it look how modest and beautiful this is the second i hand it in the paranoia sets in right im like yo im gonna get caught my parents are gonna find out this is a very real fear and theres a stereotype that immigrant parents are hard on their kids and their grades you know it you feel it but–but it–they should be because think about what they gave up my dad sees his mother every five years so that i can get a better education than he did and i refuse to be educated like i want to be dumb and the way this guy works he works so hard i feel for my dad man we get home that day im sitting there were eating dinner in silence right always he never–he– he cant talk after work you see that– that look on your dad its like his forehead– its like i feel like if i talk hell die like if he hears my shrill voice he will die not a single word in the whole meal but if theres a guest well now dad cant shut the fuck up i mean this could be a stranger a stranger shows up all of a sudden my dad has a personality one time we were at olive garden were sitting were having our meal the waiter comes he takes my dads card he looks at it and he goes oh your last name is youssef i have a friend named youssef my dad goes actually our real last name is metwally but we changed it to youssef when we came over because we thought it would be easier to sayand i was like what i didnt know my name until olive garden and my dads sitting here telling this guy stuff about his immigration story uncles ive never heard of all to alex at olive garden the guy goes to handle the check i go after him and i say hey man when you get back to the table could you ask my dad if he likes me he just really seems to trust you yeah maybe ask him what he wants for his birthday uh he says were the gift but i–i dont think we are were sitting in silence eating the phone rings i know my dad puts it on speaker its the teacher he says sir im sorry to disrupt your dinner but im reading this book report and its clear your son didnt write it now i dont want to upset you so what i like to offer the parents is why dont you come by pick up the report you read it you tell me if you think he wrote it ill be here late all week i read every single reportim like dude what a fucking loser like im like you read every report like bro get a wife you dont even get paid like these guys– like you work on tips i go to my mom you try to keep everything from your parents but if somethings gotta be– you go to mom you can work with mom right moms negotiating deals left and right things are happening curfews are being lifted outfits are being approved dads at work hes got his principles hes got his values moms at home and shes like i think we could change a lot of those you can work with me she would tell me what to say every single time and i would say exactly what she said and when i finished saying it shed go  like shed never heard any of it before like i was this disgusting thing they raised so she goes when he comes home tell him whats for dinner i made all his favorites right and im–im ready like im–im– my dad comes to the door im like the most nervous maître d ever im like sir oh my god weve got a culinary experience i mean were gonna take you down the nile its gonna be beautiful he goes im not hungry i retreat back to the kitchen i tell my mom hes not hungry she says thats not goodwere waiting im just waiting to die im like i hope its quick we believe in halal itll be a clean cut half hour goes by i start to peek out of the kitchen i go into the living room and i see my dad in my book report but hes actually so close that i realize its like open and its on his neck its just going up and down and then it hits me im like he–he fell asleep like my dad doesnt know how to read either its so exciting my moms like yes lets eat upstairs she starts packing up our food like were leaving cuba like we got bags were taking bags from the kitchen she hands a plate to my sister up the stairs she turns around hands me a fork but as she does it slips through my fingers clangs on the steps my dad shoots awake you know that feeling when you see your dads eyes and hes been awoken like a dads allowed to be awake but not awoken its like you could see a raccoon at night but not at lunch its sick he goes come herehe says you know what i realized i dont need to judge this book report when the only judge is allahno and then he goes swear to god that you wrote this now thats cra– thats hard for me i believe in this i believe in this now more than ever there has to be an unseen because i cant believe in anything im seeing the world is so crazy there has to be so i–i really– i try not to lie i try to be the best muslim i can im trying to hit all five you know weve got– we got five prayers i try to hit them all but its–its– its with the sun the schedule is tight and sometimes youre out and you gotta pray and you gotta find a spot but you dont want to do it in front of other people you dont want to make them feel uncomfortable you know so muslims well– well find places that are out of the way well find weird spots like under a bridge an alleyway like we pray where people do drugs you ever like kick a needle put down a mat one time im in an alleyway in chicago i get up off the mat i turn around theres two dudes on the mat with me on crack straight–just straight crack looking at me and theyre saying brother lets fly to allah this guy starts going up he thinks its a magic carpet hes ready it was beautiful i–i let him lead this stuff means so much so when your parents use it against you its hard and im a kid and im being asked this scary question and when youre a kid youre way more afraid of your dad than god right cause what do you learn about religion theyre like god is the most gracious most merciful sick cause this guy is like no merciful i mean theres no mercy yeah im gonna lie ill deal with god lateri go this is my favorite book best book i ever readmy dad goes thats all i needed to hearnext day we go to the school my dad says the weirdest lie ive ever heard walks up to the teacher and goes sir this is the most beautiful book report i have ever read and i have read manyand then he goes we love gandhi so many lies all cause of my lie im watching these men just lie so much shame it was really like— and it–and it never– like i think of all the guilt all the shame i felt in my life for so many different things just the things we feel as we do things that we dont want to do or that challenge who we are but all my guilt it all started with gandhi and ive never told my dad which is hard because hes like my best friend now like we–we talk about every– you know when your dad just all of a sudden is like im done now i just complain more than you i bring him to stuff like i brought him to this– this hollywood thing you know and he put on a suit he had a little bow tie this person i work with comes up to him and goes sir you should be so proud of your son hes one of the best writers that ive ever worked with i just love reading his work and my dad has the biggest smile on his face and he goes sir the thing is ramy has always been such an advanced writer he was so good that the school couldnt believe how well he wrote about gandhi no this is my dads favorite story about me its–its–its i have this dream its like a recurring dream where im dead its the day of judgment all of what i did on earth is getting added up– the good the bad im even  i look up at god gandhi walks in  god goes tell me what you know about him and im like um uh he was nonviolent he led a nonviolent movement thats all i know except gandhi hit his wife you guys know that yeah he–i–i skimmed it bad to women bad weird shit so i go gandhi hit his wife why dont we talk about that and god goes whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you cant just shout feminist things and not read this isnt earth  and at the end of the dream i– i–i still go to heaven i do god goes youre– youre a liar but you never had a christmas tree get up there thats–thats all god cares about so i could never read man so im in this girls room im looking at this flag im thinking about gandhi as i often do she comes back we start talking about it we get into it and you know what those conversations are like theyre weird because at the core it feels like everybody wants the same thing nobody likes violence everyone wants to feel seen everyone wants to feel safe but–but theres too many emotions so like the facts dont even add up its just such an emotional conversation cause everybody has their programming right she has her programming i have my programming mines right i talk to my therapist about a lot of this uh emotional thoughts that come to my head i like going to therapy im the only one in my family who does you feel that you know you ever try talking to them about it my uncle looks at me like im crazy he makes me think the therapy im doing is stupid the way he phrases it hell be like wait you pay a guy to talk talk to me pay me im like yeah but im talking to him because of you like that that made him cry that made him cry not cause of the emotional damage he just–he couldnt believe he created an expense he was like i cost you moneytried to get my mom to go i got her to do the consultation you know the–the therapist just to try it out im like howd it go mom she goes she–she was so nosy my dad hell call me hell complain to me for like an hour this is what your mothers doing and i cant get her to stop hell tell me all his suspicions you know like the neighbor hes fbi and then at the end of the call sarcastically hell be like i wonder what your little therapist would say about that then he calls me the next day and he says so what did he say whats the plan how do i–how do i talk to your mom my dad thinks my therapy is like a verizon family plan ive got cousins calling my sessions dont even make sense the therapist is like hows work going im like its good but what do you do when your children leave he goes you have kids im like dude i have menopause i have shit that we gotta figure out my mothers bodys changing they dont believe in it they dont believe in anything that costs too much money but weird things too like my dad doesnt believe in homeless people anyone have that with their dad like he thinks theyre not actually homeless theyre all pretending were walking i try to give this dude money i–i reach my dad grabs my hand and he goes this guys got more money than both of us im like what are you talking about hes like he doesnt pay taxes he keeps everything in the cup hes an actor like youyou should have seen this guy like he didnt even have legs my dads like no no no hes got more legs than both of us hes convinced the cardboard is above a manhole he goes we wait we wait till midnight youll see right at  he starts hopping hopping around new york this is why im in therapy i go with my wife anyone go with their partner to therapy – whoo – whoo yeah a couple its people think its– people think its weird my friends are like— like bro why are you going so soon youre supposed to go later like— like after you cheat thats why i want to go now i want to–i want to know how to do it cause you see people get in fights right they–they dont talk for like four days and then just on the fifth day they start talking to each other its–and i dont want to lose those days i was like what if those four days could just be like four hours what if they could be four minutes cause i know how to be so we go together and its great cause we get all these tools the therapist is like im giving you tools cause youre working on the relationship so we got this toolbox so im sitting im on my phone i look up at my wife she looks upset so i go let me check in its a tool i go hey are you ok she goes yeah im fine all right sick and i go back to my phone like i did what i needed to do im on my phone for like three more hours and then–and then i look up and shes still– she looks upset and i go let me check in again i go hey are you– are you sure youre ok and she goes ramy ive never been better im like fuck all right im cooked theres no tool for that like thats bad thats bad right next day weve got therapy its court everythings laid out shes got evidence events all the stuff thats happened all laid out right now i gotta–im–im upset cause i go why are you bringing this up now i checked in you said you were fine and she goes no no no no no you only noticed me when i got angry i spent the whole week trying to talk to you i tried to say something here i tried to say something here every single time you were too busy or you were tired you only noticed when i got angryand i was just like whoa this is a lot you know like this feels– i feel very misunderstood all these events have been misinterpreted here i didnt mean to blow you off here i was actually scared i explain every single thing right and im going long like im going  im eating the whole session right cause i gotta defend my life im gonna take all the time and then at the end of it she goes you never told me any of that and im like yeah i dont know and she goes no no no you never express yourself you never show me the real you unless hes hereand i look at the therapist and im like oh my god this is– its alex from olive garden like im my father i can only speak if theres a white guy in the room like i–i think thats colonialism so you know we start from here♪ ♪thank you for sharing this space

boy good boy you shake that baby if you want good boy cheersthis is my first new standup for seven years if you dont count the golden globes which you shouldnt the golden globes very different god a different vibe two hundred million people watching and its live big thrill but with that many people watching theres a bit of stick everyones different everyones a blogger everyone goes i was offended why he said an horrible thing he said loads of horrible things yeah but that was a thing that i care about thats the thing about offense its about personal feelings i dont care about the backlash comedian in hot water you know my girlfriend jane she worries and she reads things what have you said dont worry they wont come to the house fuck em so i wind her up i pretend im gonna say much worse things than i ever would i have to make up worse jokes than i actually just to scare my girlfriend when i do the golden globes we go out about a week before its in la we fly out im writing jokes as the ceremony approaches they release more presenters i take my pick i got a good intro for them yeah mel gibson ill introduce him yes about three days before this last one just to wind jane up i said i got a good intro she went what i said bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren i didnt do it she said you wont do that i said no next day i got her again i said is this too much i said not even bill cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy i didnt do it i would never id never tell a joke like that its horrible i was just doing it to annoy jane id never even think of that so dont even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo i said ill start with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke she went what i said what did the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas jane went i dont know i said cancer i didnt do it so youre getting offended at a joke that doesnt exist so id never say that in public so to anyone who mattered anyway so dont i didnt have to worry about offending anyone it just happensthe big controversy last time i did it was a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day i mean a couple of people going it was transphobic it wasnt transphobic in the slightest it was a joke about a trans person but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and thats the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target theyre not necessarily the same ill tell you the joke you make your minds up its live so they go your host for the  annual golden globes awards please welcome ricky gervais theyre all clapping the actors are smiling at me nervously its brilliant right so i just go relax im gonna be nice tonight ive changed not as much as bruce jenner obviously and i go now caitlyn jenner of course and what a year shes had became a role model for trans people everywhere bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes she didnt do a lot for women drivers thats a clever joke ill tell you why right its layered no listen right the subject of that joke is stereotypes im playing with the notion of stereotypes i start by saying shes a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if shes a real woman i hit them with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car lets not forget that shall we a celebrity killing someone in their car running home and popping on a dress thats the target of the joke just so were clear okay she was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers now cancelled and one of the press said what do you think of the ricky gervais joke she went maybe i should host the golden globes and they tweeted that and ed me in because they want a celebrity feud it was clickbait i rose to the bait obviously i just sent back let her host just dont let her drive another website that was in the room entertainment weekly they tweeted a different headline and they ed me in their headline was caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais i just sent back at last she always brakes too late bring it on bring it on but im a considered comedian i like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair so i was engaging these people saying why is it transphobic they said its about a trans person thats ridiculous thats like saying a joke about bill cosby is automatically racist it depends on the joke but im willing to learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her id never heard that term before a day after the golden globes and that was saying her old name and even acknowledging she used to be a man but she did i saw him on the olympic games he was a decathlete he was in everything all over the place shot put and pole vault he won a medal he was famous he was on telly all the time you know a big famous man with a huge i dont know im guessing probably he was big but ive learnt my lesson now i know its wrong id never deadname her now but years ago when she was a man years ago im saying and she went to the doctor and knocked on the door the doctor went come in this is years ago id never deadname her now but this is like a flashback before anyone you know what so so like come in and he went hello bruce jenner because that that was his name then the doctor– this was years ago the doctor went all right bruce jenner how you doing you fucker you big old lunk how you doing come here you you fucker how you doing brucie boy and bruce jenner– that was his name this is years ago right so bruce jenner went yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah what can i do for you bruce you fucker how you doing boy and bruce jenner went– that was his name bruce jenner went look at that the doctor went come on bruce jenner you know the rules he uses his whole name every time for some reason come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rules you cant bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here mate bruce jenner went no thats not my pole thats my enormous penis well seeing as its your penis you can bring it in here but you should have left your shot puts outside and bruce jenner went that was his name for fiftyeight years i think he went no theyre not my shot puts doctor theyre my enormous testicles thats where i keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor went oh yeah that makes perfect– im a medical man youre a big bloke you fucker how you doing boy youre a big youre big and you would have a big old cock and balls theyre beautiful bit familiar innit no you must be very proud of them bruce bruce went this is going to surprise you doctor i wanna get rid of them and the doctor went what why oh they get in the way in the way of what fucking driving for one thingso im engaging these people and im saying but i had to say her old name thats the joke i say ive changed not as much as bruce jenner then i do the joke but no this is my second crime i say she hasnt changed shes always identified as a woman that means shes a woman fine if thats the rules if you feel youre a woman you are im not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far in fact i dont think its going far enough cause ive always identified as a chimp right well i am a chimp if i say im a chimp i am a chimp preop but dont ever deadname me dont call me ricky gervais again from now on you call me bobo im gonna have species realignment im halfway there im short with short legs and long arms i stoop my backs getting hairier by the day ive got fangs like that i love nuts i love nuts once i was at the zoo and people were looking at me so i just started masturbating like so i am a chimp right i am a chimp if i say im a chimp ive got to live as a chimp for a year then have hormones get me all nice and hairy thatd be lovely im gonna stay a male chimp so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so you know i reckon thats got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp were so close than for a man to turn into a woman in many ways a bit of hair and a top lip like that as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off and a hole gouged out into– im not a doctor but that is the gist of it i know which one id rather have done im not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i cant see you but to me every single one of you is equal to a chimp so so id have all that done hair and that id do all that all the ill retain the ability to speak english like in emergencies im talking to jane shes going what is it what is it bobo you left the fucking oven on theres a fire are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by a wolf and there was a big fence but she had a long pole shed revert shed be over that fucking easy so id have all that done top lip doing all that right ill be legally a chimp ill be well properly chimpedup ill be able to use chimp toilets ill be walking along holding janes hand come on bobo right we dont hold hands now i dont know why shes all over me now im a chimp but well be all in love maybe matching jumpers come on bobo in love just two like that then if a bigot in a van slows down and goes thats fucking disgusting ill fling shit at him and run up a tree and thats why that joke isnt transphobic so cheersso humanity what is humanity what are we well weve touched upon it there were great apes not metaphorically were literally great apes we are  genetically identical to a chimpanzee were closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which is our parents mate were born we grow we mate our parents die our friends die and then we die now my sevenyearold niece didnt like hearing that but i said youve gotta learn stop crying i said youre seven you know today so any more grizzling and this partys cancelled so lets take the first of those birth its odd because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period i mean because of our evolution our brain is so big we have to get that huge head out early thats why the skull is in parts and supple then we go on gestating outside the womb thats why were so useless look at other mammals a giraffe is walking along it goes im proper pregnant right im gonna have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it is see you later and the baby goes mum its got to be fucking ready were were helpless right just think nine months were growing in this perfect environment everythings its like being in a little kate bush video right then suddenly youre being squeezed out of an hole near an ass youre covered in shit theres screaming you go i cant breathe someone goes yes you fucking can the first one second of life on earthyou dont know where you are you cant choose where youre born i was born in whitley estate in reading right i wouldnt have chosen that id have chosen hampstead i did choose hampstead it just took  years to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how i live now now i live a privileged life hampstead is ridiculous its a rarefied place its like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me new money right but growing up it was tough i dont know about now but in my day my estate was rough and scary it felt like wildlife i was weak and vulnerable there was danger round every corner my school was on my street and i ran there every day so i didnt get mugged or molested there werent many pedophiles in reading the murderers had killed a lot but there was still a couple i moved to hampstead oh my god theres no crime i saw a knife once in hampstead it was a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone gobbing on it or calling him bender it was weirdi know my life has changed drastically it wasnt always like that as a famous person you read about yourself gossip and twitter and everything one thing kept cropping up even as i prepared for this tour people kept saying hes out of touch hes so famous hes rich hes megarich i am right i could have this place burnt down for a laugh no but they say things like hes an observational comedian how can he say things that relate to ordinary scum and i say i say dont call them scum right but even the papers they try and get around to it i do interviews and theyll always say do you always fly first class i go no often private right the number of times ive answered this question they say do you know how much a pint of milk is to make you look out of touch i dont know but thats irrelevant next time a journalist asks me ill say i dont know but heres a grand run and get me one is that enough that enough yeahanother question i always get particularly with the posh sundays doing a profile piece theyre still trying to alienate you make you look different they say things like you dont have children i say no why dont you have children which is an odd question why dont you have children as opposed to asking people why do you have children lets ask the fat lady in the leggings why shes had eight shall we nine that one just fell out that one didnt even touch the sides or disturb her cigarette that one just go and claim for that people say its selfish to not have children how is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesnt exist on any level theres not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going we want to be born right but ive thought about it and theres three reasons i dont have children three main reasons and ill share them with you three reasons one theres millions the worlds overpopulated noones going ricks not having kids were gonna run out fuck two kids are scroungers arent they i mean from day one its all me me me isnt it feed me clothe me pay for my chemotherapy no no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it costs the average household in the west  to bring up a child and they dont want to pay you back theyre not grateful they dont go thanks for having me its i didnt wanna be born even if they get a top job which they wont youll never see that money back theyll just put you in a home okay and my kid hed be born into ridiculous wealth wouldnt he so hed be a little cunt a little hampstead cunt running around with all the other fucking little hampstead cunts being all hampstead and cunty im a little hampstead cunt yes i know these are my cunty friends i know its obvious i can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that youre little hampstead cunts you little posh hampstead first hed know he was a little hampstead cunt im a little yes we know everyone knows right hed know that right on the other hand hed know hed never live up to being as brilliant as his dad id say i worked my way up from nothing and youre just a useless hampstead cunt hed go yeah and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit eleven twelve hed be naughty run with the wrong crowd try and get out from under my shadow then hed turn to drugs about  hed come home and overdose on my afghan rug twenty grand that was right and as he was there convulsing and throwing up his fucking lungs right and with his little posh highpitched fucking death rattle his little fucking dying words hed go do you love me now daddy no no no i never did thats why youll never be born you useless fucking junkie hampstead cunt and three id worry sick about him you know no i would ive only got a cat now and i worry sick about her i check the door three times when i go out so she doesnt escape i put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and shes peckish a human baby oh my god the responsibility of a human life id watch it sleep you know we said how weak and vulnerable they are oh my god you perfect little thing oh you flesh of my flesh now go to sleep in your expensive cot like that night night sleep tight dont let the bedbugs dead yeah just why why is it dead its just fucking dead look fucks sake fucking hell what the what a fucking waste of time that was fucks sake embarrassing jane what come here im in the shower come here what fucking dead already i didnt just fucking fucking hell jane you call that a baby that is if jane was out id have to text her wouldnt i what could you babys dead shed come back what the fuck id go yep forget the pampers lol but even if it made it through the terrifying cot years and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables with their sharp edges id have to pad them so it didnt run into it cave its head in and die then social services come round and say is this your child mr gervais yeah what happened here then i go its a fucking idioti did think of adopting for a while a little third world child because that would tick all three boxes one i wouldnt be adding to the population problem id be alleviating an existing problem a young kid born through no fault of his own into abject poverty he would have died i can literally save his life and give him a great upbringing right two he would be grateful wouldnt he hed wanna pay me back woudnt he particularly if i let him know the other kids in the village werent so lucky they didnt they didnt make it out right id tell him that early on so he really bucked his ideas up id go tunde come here come here yeah yeah go and pop a shirt on youre not in africa now thats better yeah tunde look– yeah water straight out of a tap innit yes yeah yeah no its not free its hampstead you know but yeah course its safe safe fresh drinking water have as much as you want have a bucket full fresh drinking water there you go go and clean the car go on no id go look remember all your friends in the village back in africa theyre all dead a rich man didnt save them and bring them to hampstead do you wanna pay me back yeah yeah i bet you do the good thing about them is they can start work when theyre about six i just call up nike and i go do you still make your stuff in sweatshops got a great little worker here yeah pound a days fine hes gotta start somewhere and three if he ran round and caved his head in and died and social services came round and said is this your child mr gervais id go does it look like mine id go this is hampstead its obviously broken in thats why i dont have kids even though i dont have children of my own people still show me photos of theirs like i give a shit i dont mean my own family theyve given up ive got older brothers and sisters theyve had loads of kids and their kids have kids and then their kids theres about  i dont know all their names i see them at christmas its all uncle ricky they know ive got a bit of cash they go through my pockets and then fuck off its like being mugged by mice right i dont mean them i mean strangers i could be busy i could be working like on the set of a tv or film or something stressed producing or directing it you get someone whos in for one day with one line or a stuntman they introduce themselves good be with you in a minute then they hover busy i go yeah yes yeah they go working the weekend i go not filming but ill be in the edit im taking my youngest to ballet lessons ah great great yeah shes eight ive got a photograph i go you know what show me it if she goes missing ill keep an eye open in the woods youve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole and go shes beautiful its gotta be long too short its awkward they know you go yeah right too long and its like shes shes fucking beautiful its a minefield innitso im not out of touch but i am spoiled theres a difference i didnt have any money until i was  ive got the same family friends and values but i am spoiled because opportunity and privilege spoils you and it doesnt take much il give you an example when i first made it in america the next time we flew were met by a bloke in a suit and a thing and he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side the first time youre horrified everyones looking pretending to be late baseball cap oh god next time we flew i went wheres that bloke im not queueing its quick when i fly to the states ive got a place there but im always working so someone else is paying so i go first class ba it doesnt get any better even if i was paying id still go first class but jane would probably be in coach its ten grand a pop that new planet of the apes movies on shell love that shell be up for that but when someone else is paying i say jane get up here with me right front two seats they board us early were on the plane about  minutes before anyone else god they bring round these snacks these warmed caramelized nuts in a bowl champagne its great its like a day off no phone or anything its like a holiday flying to the statesi could do without the safety video thats always a bit of a downer and totally pointless if you hit the side of a mountain at  miles per hour the brace position does fuck all imagine if that worked youre going down the plane smashes you go ill try it you do that ball of flames you wake up everyones dead you go fucking hell thats amazing that is and they always use that voice dont they that calming hypnotic voice like nothing bad will happen theyre saying horrendous things but nothing bad will happen because im using this voice dont worry things like in the event of the plane landing on water– it smashes the fuck to bits right they say in the event of the plane landing on water your life jacket is equipped with a whistle a fucking whistle so the plane hits the water smashes to bits everyones dead except you by a miracle youre bobbing around in the atlantic ocean four degrees that water is youve got about  minutes before hypothermia sets in or youre eaten by a shark or you drown youre hoping theyve sent airsea rescue youre going god im gonna die i dont know what im doing hold on i mean air sea rescue i dont know if youve ever been in a helicopter o course you havent but theyre fucking loud its like having your head in a washing machine you have to wear ear plugs and defenders your teeth rattle its like like that over the atlantic ocean at night never gonna happen if you crash you die rightbut apart from that its brilliant right i was flying heathrow to jfk just before christmas right boarded us early on the plane she comes round champagne in a wine glass like you like it mr gervais she goes off i go have you got any of them warm nuts she went were not handing out nuts on this flight a ladys getting on whos so allergic even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction i went oh my god of course i was fuming i mean whats that got to do with me why cant i eat nuts just cause fucking this woman will die right nuts how has she lived this long if walking by a nut kills you if being just near a nut how has she never been near a nut before and how has she lived long enough having never been near a nut how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane right honestly its and if being near a nut kills you do we really want that in the gene pool i mean i never wanted nuts more i felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts and this is how spoiled i am okay i actually had this thought i thought oh i wish id brought my own nuts on right i thought for a second but that wouldnt work shed get on and start blowing up like a frog right like that and die and someone would go ricky gervais brought his own nuts on you know right so i dont take my own nuts on now before i fly i have a shower and then i rub myself all over in nuts just in case then i go can i have any nuts they go no sorry this lady would die yeah not a problem lady gets on sits down starts blowing up like a frog i go whats the matter i touch her all over whats the matter she goes nuts right and dies and i go whos been eating nuts i get off scotfreeso i got to america i went on a chat show tonight show with jimmy fallon and i told that story the whole thing it went well audience laughed great went out next day on twitter outrage by outrage i mean one person going how dare you this woman goes i saw you on jimmy fallon making fun of nut allergies my daughters nutintolerant how dare you i go who is this woman shes tweeted  times she starts ing nbc and jimmy fallon i go whats this how many followers twentythree ignore it you know when youre being told off and they use your own words against you like a teacher going so you find so and so funny and cause the teachers really angry yes you do find that thing funny whatever she said would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog yeah yeah you saying that yes if you said that at the funeral i would yeah so someone else gets involved ohio moms against nuts right and she does a blog and theyre talking to each other and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting i am one filmed her little girl put it on youtube and sent me it i opened it sweet little girl seven years old and she went dear mr gervais i have a fatal nut allergy delete not my problem right ignore ignore ignore right but then one of them said something that reeled me in just cause im this selfconfessed twitter police i try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means particularly in the context of comedy and in the context of a joke a joke about a bad thing isnt as bad as the bad thing or necessarily condoning the bad thing it could be anti the bad thing it depends on the actual joke and this woman said you should never make jokes about food allergies i should have left it right i sent back i make jokes about aids cancer famine and the holocaust and youre telling me i should never joke about food allergies she sent back yes but the holocaust didnt kill children well it did didnt it it was horrible the holocaust some would say as bad as food allergies didnt kill children jesus it did kill children hitler killed  million people many of them children i have to say hitler you couldnt make him up the worst human being to walk the face of the earth he is a crazy evil racist narcissistic serial killer just terrible but if i was throwing a dinner party and id been slaving over a hot stove and i was getting everything ready and there was one place left and i had to either invite hitler or that little girl with food allergies i know whod ruin that party more everyones enjoying it everything okay ja ist yummy right hes loving it i go cheers you fucker how you doing boy shes going i cant eat that fucking hell who wants ferrero rocher me all right here i cant eat them oh fuck off home rightthats what the worlds like people see something they dont like they expect it to stop as opposed to deal with their emotions they want us to care about their thing as much as they do its why the world is getting worse and the world is getting worse i think ive lived through the best  years of humanity  to  the peak of civilization for everything for tolerances for freedoms for communication for medicine now its going the other way a bit last couple of years just a little blip maybeim not saying this because im old old people say things like oh everything was better when i was a kid course it was you were a kid everythings better when youre a kid being old is the shit bit whatevers happening being old is i wake up these days and i go oh fuck i didnt die gotta do it all again im usually hung over headache liver pains i cant walk for the first five minutes cause ive got no joints in my knees im getting fat again now right i was thin till i was about  proper skinny like nine and a half stone then i got a job right and the next sort of  years were what i call my eating years and i just got steadily fatter and fatter until i reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness when i was about  years old there was one christmas i was at home lying on the floor and i was saying to jane im having a heart attack right and honestly my heart rate was like  i felt nauseous i had palpitations i was sweating because id eaten eleven sausages true story right i was like one of them snakes like when you see a big like python swallow a pig whole and then its just fucked its like itll sit there for a week its like a duffel bag just there like that that was me right i wasnt having a heart attack but it worried jane she said you gotta look after yourself i thought youre right  so i started working out right every day i didnt give anything up i dont eat meat anymore but i was having   calories a day including wine every night but i burnt it off the next day just so i could do all that i worked out every day running weight training i had more time on my hands than the average person i had a gym in my house i had no excuse i lost  pounds it was great but now i still eat and drink too much but i physically cant burn off the calories i cant do enough cause im so old and broken and tired so im going to get steadily fatter and fatter again and this time i am going to dieim losing my hair its getting really thin i know it looks great from there cheers but no honestly in a lift with that light directly overhead and the mirror it looks like an xray right ill have to buzz that off soon id never wear a wig oh my god if you wear a wig or a toupee and you think youve got away with it you havent everyone knows everyone knows immediately my brain knows a wig has come into the room before i do right i could be at a party itll go theres a wig in here i go is there yes there is yeah spidey senses for the wig its obvious the way they smile like nothings wrong hiya its the telltale signs isnt it i was put off wigs for life by my uncle reginald great bloke hes dead now died a few years ago i was only little he went bald in his twenties tragically bald his hair fell out it might have been something like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house elvis what is– i was about eight i said to auntie edna what happened she went it was a miracle they were lying they were just everyone knew he was bald but hed embroiled his family in the lie so they had to lie as well theyre going yeah it just grew back theres so much he wouldnt do cause he was terrified of the wig coming off we werent allowed balloons at parties right auntie edna said reg is allergic to balloons he wasnt allergic he was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater and his wig would fly across the room weve got photos in the family album if hes at a wedding or a christening and hes holding a baby its always at arms length like that so it cant grab his wig it must have been on his mind all the time right it was the only thing he feared the wig coming off in public and this ridiculous lie being exposed he was in the army hard as nails he wasnt scared of anyone or anything spiders snakes cancer hows the chemo going uncle not a problem weve got a photo of him the last year i think he was  it must have been the last year he was alive it was a hot day he was in the garden in his little trunks he was a wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died in it buried in it hes wearing it now a little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternitybut i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old and fat and ill and blind and deaf and shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket youre ready because youre warned you know about getting old what they dont talk about so youre not prepared and it was a shock to me i only found out recently ill share it with you now the distending testicles see you dont know about it but it happens in your fifties i wasnt checking them or anything i didnt see em for  years as a young man they were pert and now theyre like two plums in a sock i dont know when it happened but it was recently they just and this is how i found out so as ive been getting older and theyve been secretly stretching away as ive got older ive got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was in there the first night lovely bath sun streaming in classical music this is the life i looked down and theyre floating right now id never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like theyd be heavy you could tie things down with them and theyd sink you know most people never see their in the sea youre in trunks in the shower they dangle and baths arent usually that deep that was my first thought oh my god i never thought testicles would float then my second thought kicked in hold on this baths two feet deep right im sitting on the bottom theyre on top whats going on right and i looked and my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right in fact theyd created a little fleshy sort of life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it a little whistle im just thinking this is bizarre fucking hell right and i thought maybe its a fluke so i held them under the water for a minute i let them go and they bobbed up theyre really theyre really buoyant right try it when you get home if youre in your  and a man obviously or caitlyn jennerbut but the world is getting worse and i blame the beginning of its demise on social media because twitter and facebook thats where this ridiculous notion bred and became stable that it was more important to be popular than right everything was like me agree with me it falls into two tribes i dont agree with them so i block them and now in this posttruth era people dont care about the argument they say whos saying the argument no theyre not on our side its ludicrous okay and it also bred this ridiculous notion weve always had my opinion is worth as much as yours now its my opinion is worth as much as your fact which is nonsense i get tweets from people saying i believe the earth is  years old i believe youre a fucking idiot you cant have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right and even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want to be popular we had a brexit referendum cause they passed the buck they didnt want to make a mistake and theres a ridiculous thing of lets ask the average person what they think lets stop asking the average person what they do you know how fucking stupid the average person is we still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say do not drink right lets take those labels off right for two years and then have a referendum but its not just politicians even real news the news on tv says things like tweet us your news dont let them tweet you the news i saw a tyrannosaurus rex you liar right there was a big news story last year about a train crash that happened a year before and there was an inquiry the results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news he said weve looked at everything and weve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor so were going to slow them down a bit statistically this shouldnt happen again that would have been it but the guy went we asked the public what they thought then there was three banal vox pops first one said i already pay £ a year so im not happy the next one said it takes me  minutes each way its not good enough the last one said i say its better to arrive at work late than dead why is that on the news and when is that applicable in any situation all right ted youre in early ted oh ted weve been through this remember i said id rather you arrive late than deadbut the big enemy is stupidity right i wanna share with you the most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not to change anyones opinions i thought it was important to tell the other side there are still  countries where people are put to death for being an atheist i just wanted to say its fine to be an atheist its fine to believe in god and its fine not to thats all i was saying i realized i didnt have to tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet a fact and that annoyed just the right people id tweet things like happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today someone would always go we know what youre fucking doing this is a tweet i got after one of those and it was all in capitals which excited me thats the sign of twitter madness mixed with anger its great right i looked at his profile sure enough hes a gentleman from texas hes a fundamentalist creationist christian which is fine he loves god he loves god and fetuses mainly he loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay and then hes remember its in capitals hes shouting at me best tweet ever your science– my science right science by the way is spelled scients already good isnt it i mean hes obviously heard the word he took a guess never seen it written down because its not in the bible so hes your scients wont help you well it will its helping him beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me your scients wont help you when satan of course he believes in satan why not he believes that god made the universe in six days youre not gonna say to him do you believe in satan and have him say bit farfetched why doesnt god kill satan thats what id ask him if i was wrong and i met god id go oh you do exist hed go yeah id go ive got a few fucking questions mate the first one would be why did you make chocolate kill dogs mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put the male gspot up the arse what what is wrong with you then id say why dont you kill satan and hed go what id go why dont you kill satan if he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff which you want i mean you do want– yes yeah you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy yeah why dont you kill him then because shut up your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass and hes got a point because if i die and i find myself in hell being raped by satan science has pretty much let me down but its this last line that he just throws away the line he signs off with makes this the best tweet ive ever received your scients wont help you when satan is raping your british ass ill be laughing so hes there too hes so hes a fundamentalist christian whos lived his life by the old and new testaments he dies he wakes up in hell right which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma oh my god im in hell oh my god why have you forsaken me im gonna be tortured for eternity he sees me getting raped and goes ha ha ha hes suddenly over it is he his days suddenly got a little bit brighter and like hes not next right so im getting raped right by the devil right hes just there you fucking atheist scum and im like that yeah whatever i assume it happens all eternity yeah yeah whatever like that i might say watch your hooves on my testicles and hed go why are they so distended and i go oh like youre brad pitt you know what i mean sorry are we talking or raping can we you lying fucking atheist hes probably bored fucking atheists every fucking day right his little gargoyle comes up satan he goes what and i go yeah what he goes theres a fundamentalist christian fuck this hed be on him like a ton of bricksso i got that tweet i loved it all i did was retweet right and just watch the fun people piling on going ah loser and hes fighting back really witlessly saying things like go fuck your sister you english faggot that makes no sense at all i forgot about it went and did something else few hours later on twitter again its still all going off right its really funny im laughing at all the replies people saying things to him im scrolling down theres one tweet directly to me from this woman she says you find rape funny no no what no your mates find rape funny no listen right you find rape funny listen everyone listen right no i said to her i didnt tweet that she went you retweeted it to show hes an idiot but you must find it funny or amusing its not a frivolous thing i said no well its up to him isnt it he can do it now im arguing with quite a nice sane person who thinks this is mental but im fighting for his right to fantasize about me being raped by the devil because im so conscious of freedom of speech what a topsyturvy world right although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit because she did that thing that people do she didnt say what you find jokes about rape funny she said what you find rape funny the answer to that is no of course not no one finds rape funny not even rapists find rape funny know what i mean noone ever gives evidence saying it was dark he wore a ski mask and he was giggling thats never so i sent back you mean jokes about rape she said yes i went depends on the joke it fucking doesnt im going no it does it does it depends on the joke its about context its about content what do you mean by a rape joke she said even a joke with the word rape in it is unacceptable i said thats ridiculous it depends what the joke is i tweeted that clip of me in the office going i think theres been a rape up there everyone gets that because of the context and the target is a middleaged man whos so narcissistic hell say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it comes from i said some jokes dont punch up or down they dont punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play on words that dont really mean anything a joke went round when i was a kid even adults told it ill tell you a woman goes running into a police station she says help ive been graped the policeman says do you mean raped she says no there was a bunch of them that is a rape joke right so and i even said to her no i agree in most cases yeah real rape jokes they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target disgusting id never tell those but it depends on the joke not the word or the subject i calmed it down and they agreed some jokes are worse than others she ended it by saying well okay i see your point but still i will laugh at a joke with the word rape in it when noone in the audience has been raped i should have left it i just sent back what a weird door policy you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone says can i just ask you a question yeah have you ever been raped i have yes you cant come in what why a lady says she wont laugh if youre in off you gothats what the world is like people take everything personally they think the world revolves around them particularly on twitter im not tweeting anyone im just tweeting i dont know whos following me ive got  million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally thats like going into a town square seeing a big noticeboard saying guitar lessons and you go but i dont fucking want guitar lessons whats this theres a number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i dont fucking want any fine its not for you then just walk away dont worry about iti should say one thing in twitters defense i use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally im very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages to get  signatures on a petition standing outside tescos or something thats the magic number because then it gets heard in parliament ive been part of many campaigns through twitter when weve got  signatures in days and the law has been changed thank you to those whove retweeted about animal cruelty it makes a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no ones gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard ill tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment i say ban bullfighting someone always says what about the kids in syria what well im not giving you a choice you can do both im not saying throw that kid back in the hole theres a bull hereand theres one thing that i didnt want in my head but it exists so we have to deal with it now that i found out through twitter theres a thing called the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and its horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dogs to bring them back its a drop in the ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet the details the petition people dont really read it its a kneejerk people say racist i go what they go we eat pigs and cows in the west yep we do i dont but yeah i used to youre right a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog its not about the species its what they do to these poor dogs what they do is torture the dogs first cause they think it makes the meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive and i saw this picture on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guys in this chinese square and theyre skinning this dog alive its screaming theyre laughing its the worst thing ive ever seen i thought ive got to tweet that i tweeted the picture with a petition and i just said one beautiful creature and two ugly cunts skinning it alive right and it took off loads of retweets it made the press i got one tweet back from a woman that said is that language necessary i should have left it right but i was i was incensed i said youre more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death she said i just hate the cword i definitely should have left it i sent back people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they didnt go round acting like such cunts thank you youve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so muchi hope you enjoyed the show i hope noone was offended no i really do thats not the point ive always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think its my upbringing i grew up in poverty with nothing but the point was to pay your way then have a laugh that was the men the women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right in the bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized hes healing them thats what comedys for what humors for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour in the pound shop in hayling island just asking the cashier how much everything was just to see if he could break this poor mans will bob was the first person i saw answer back to authority the first authority you come across are your parents and hed get in trouble he got sent to bed but i thought hed won the argument and hed tease my mum my mum was a typical workingclass woman as i say we lived in a shitty area right and most of the houses looked like a bit of mud and a stolen bike and fence posts missing she mended the fence turfed the garden herself painted the step she thought if it looked respectable wed be respectable it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read is that pedophile postman still reading your mail and shed take it shed go in and shed be horrified shed call bob he saw it this time you must stop doing that even at her funeral my mum died first and my dad carried on for a year or so just drinking beer then he went at mums funeral we had different duties i did catering and flowers bob went to see the local vicar that was a mistake right wed never been to church he didnt know us we didnt know him so he said to bob tell me about your mum so i can say a few words bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face said well she was a keen racist the vicar went i cant say that bob said okay put she liked gardening he was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church he didnt warn us and he did get something by the vicar so were called ricky robert– bob– ricky robert marsha and larry now larry is the oldest in his seventies born in the war i always thought he was the sensible one first born weight of the world on his shoulders my mum said when he was a teenager he got a job and gave her the money to help out hes a standup guy larry so bob gives the vicar the wrong name didnt warn us were all in church start of the funeral were all there packed out the coffin comes down guided by the vicar the vicar goes to his pulpit all confident with his little notes right and he goes eva leaves behind four loving children ricky robert marsha and barry and we snort like that right bobs going everyone realizes were all laughing we see larry go all right and the church is like every time we thought of it wed see larry go like that right then wed just start giggling just fits of fucking giggles right larry eventually started doing this and the vicars thinking what have i said right hed put in a few things the vicar didnt know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces and nephews started crying id come prepared with a pack of tissues theyd take one and hand it on before the funeral id taken the tissues out written on them folded them back and put them in and each tissue said snivelling fucking bitch and theyre sort of laughing so it was like a madhouse right everything the vicar said or did we all started fucking laughing right and you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit he ended the funeral and he made a beeline for me and bob he said sorry was that okay me and bob went fucking brilliant mate it was fucking brilliant thats what i mean were all gonna die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity youre bulletproof me and my brother bob had one simple rule and that was if you think of something funny youve got to say it win lose or draw it might go well it might go badly but youve gotta say it and bear that in mind as i leave you with this right so were all in the car one day bobs driving packed in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stopped for a security check and theres a british bobby there and he stops the car bobs at the window he said where are we off to bob went bognor he went can you just pop the boot please so he looks at that looks in the boot like that back to bobs window gets that mirror on a stick thing and he starts just looking under the car and as he does that his helmet falls off right and out of the helmet falls a packet of  cigarettes and the copper went bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets and bob went i knew it wasnt fucking brains youve been amazing good nightmorericky gervais standup transcripts share this article

special because i love i love chicago matter of fact i was here four years ago i was out to get lunch and i had an experience here in chicago that i have never been able to get rid of really i havent been able to shake iti was sitting next to a couple a guy and a girl two people they ordered two large pizzas and they finished them two people they ordered two large pizzas and they finished all but a slice okay you ever sit next to people having a conversation and youre listening the words coming out of their mouth are so ridiculous that you feel in your heart that you have to butt in on behalf of societyat the end of this meal the woman turned to her husband and said hun dont even get the car well walk it off i was like walk it off i hope you live in kalamazoo because crunching some numbers carry the two you need to get going you two need to leave now walk it off i suggest a sensible shoe and a canteen because you have so far to walk walk it off shes talking about it like it was a charlie horse i just watched you two eat  slices a serving is one i didnt say that i didnt say any of that ill tell you what happened i stayed quiet finished my whole pizza i didnt say i was walking it off though so it probably still is with me as a matter of factas soon as she said that i jumped on my phone i had to i googled it the average pizza  calories thats without toppings she had two lets not even talk about those you have to understand something we walk  mph as human beings and in an hour we burn  calories which means that the woman from chicago would have had to walk for  hours  hours or  miles thats the math ive done it many times ive been alive for decades okay ive lived in seven locations theyve all been within nine miles of each other this woman has to walk the length of the great lakes because she wanted double sausagei have regretted not saying something to this woman so badly that i think of her in my regular life for four years i have thought of this woman from chicago i think about her in the shower when im trying to fall asleep you know when i walk and i flew into chicago yesterday and i got like ptsd i was like chicago the woman i am so obsessed that i didnt say anything that this is where im at with this situation okay if somebody invented time travel i wouldnt even use that to like go back and save a bunch of people id go four years ago wicker park in the pizzeria and give this bitch these statistics  pm id kick the pizzeria door but id excuse myself miss im from the future are you prepared to walk until around this time tomorrow no well then everybody in the pizzeria thinks youre being very unreasonable then i turn to myself you too put it down it doesnt come off i should walk more things off i dont walk i dont go out i dont leave my house anymorei turned  years old in november  and thats where it fell off for me this is how much i dread going out seriously recently it was my best friend mikes birthday weve been friends for  years i still didnt want to go out just to get me through the night of my best friends birthday for the first time in my life i took a  energy you have experience yeah this is how bad i didnt want to go out this is how much i dreaded it i took two  energies no yeah i dont need to read the directions because i know that clearly means i get  consecutive hours of evenly distributed energy that should subside right around that last minute i had  hours of energy the second i swallowed i basically did cocaine with vitamin  i would have punched a child if one came across me i would punch a little boy right in his mouth and then asked him if he wants to start a crypto business thats how quickly i was out of my gourd okay i took  of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin  i was like its my birthday nowwe went out we drank heavy on top of that when it was time to come home im responsible i took an uber home and the uber was a fivestar ride pristine but when i got out of the uber i was so hopped up still on the energy and all the alcohol that i accidentally hit one star and i hit submit let me finish im neurotic as it is he pulled away i had a full meltdown i was afraid i ruined this mans life i was like oh my god this guys going to get fired from his uber i was thinking the worst i was like he probably has a bakers dozen worth of children they all need braces probably i sat down at  in the morning on the stoop of a home that i didnt know who lived there it wasnt me and i swear to you these words came out of my mouth oh my god this guys kids and i realized in that moment ill go in the app you can write to them if you have an issue so ah thats what i did that night i went into the app in that state of mind in that condition and i wrote to uber to save this man and his children i forgot about it i found it in my phone four months later i have the letter on me right now im going to read this to you guysi need you to keep a few things in mind okay this is a combination of  minutes of energy titos handmade vodka and autocorrect autocorrect does some of the heavy lifting here it starts off like this to ubbs it may concern next sentence everythings going great all caps coming in hot on that second sentence all caps five exclamations why am i pissed off all of a sudden what happened between the first and second sentence its not like someone at uber was like you know sir im sorry its too late we just got word his daughters are all selling their bodies also its  am and im trying to reach a human up at the uber office so it is not going greatcroutons thats the next sentence thats the subject the verb and the predicate croutons fucking period croutons is what i told them i said croutons croutons i have a major emergency here this guys kids teeth hang in the balance i told them croutons call a meeting figure it out i thought about croutons i thought about that sentence for a while too because because because what autocorrects to croutons what the hell was i trying to say that the iphone  was like no no no trust us he means croutons thats what the boy means yes we here at apple believe the boy meant the cubes of bread you put in your salads and your soups thats the end of the letter to uber if youre paying attention i didnt even mention a star this guy this guy has  kids running around the city that can never smile with confidenceto ubbs it may concern everythings going great tell your children i said youre welcome what did i even do there thats not adult behavior i logged on to uber corporate at  in the morning told them my life was fantastic i need one salad ingredient and i pieced the fuck out never to be heard from again because i told you i found that in my phone four months later i was mortified switched to lyft been using lyft ever since in my head that is printed out and its taped to the wall in the uber office it must be i feel like they use it for training purposes hey how you doing welcome to uber two weeks paid vacation break rooms over there come here tell us what the fuck you think it means croutons theres a large office prize no you laugh but i could have helped those wonky tooth little bastards i failed i live with that i feel bad about it okay because you have to when youre in a situation where you could help children you do it everyone knows thatthats a weird time to laugh weird its weird feel like do you want to just like well close our eyes you leave so we dont see you so we dont report thermometers you a couple weeks ago my young niece she didnt feel well and my sister took her temperature with a laser gun beep you seen the laser gun beep yeah you seen that yeah where was that technology in the  there was a planet full of children that could have used that technology in the  and i see young people in the audience and i dont even know if you know what im talking about i dont know if you know what we went through but when you sneezed or when you had the sniffles when i was little they had to get up your ass very quickly nobody talks about that i feel like it didnt need to happen no one talks about it lets talk about it now i dont know why the common cold in the  was so closely related to sodomy i dont know why my word to my mother that i didnt feel well wasnt good enough for herlike i said when you sneezed in  it got real weird real fast i used to sneeze in the closet for fear of retaliation seriously i was like you are never getting me i will eat an apple every day and i will sneeze amongst these coats for the younger people this is how it would go down when i was younger my mom would feel my forehead and be like he feels hot and then my dad would be like yeah but how hot hear me out why dont we stick this glass rod up his asshole and really get to the bottom of it at that point you are doing more damage than the cold the common cold goes away in  days forced penetration sticks aroundi feel like we needed one reasonable adult in the  that could have changed the course of history for us just one to be like you know what i felt his forehead he feels warm good enough for me i swear to you i felt like i had a gaggle of adults around me at all times like you need to penetrate this sick little boy now or well never know if he needs a cough drop now bend the boy over stick the mercury up his hole against his will or how will we know if he needs plenty of liquidsi know some of you are saying what about under the tongue no i was one of four okay i dont know who was reamed prior but you start with the hole you stick with the hole under the tongue is no longer an option its a glorious time for temperatures so soak it up really soak it up because one day my children are not going to know what i went through and i thought about it and i do not think that is fair so i will split the difference i will take their temperature using the laser gun but i will shove that up their fcking assand by the way lasers existed in the  the technology was there it didnt have to happen i realized that  years too late as i got older i realized so many things like that after the fact i used to live with my older grandparents as a kid and the main thing that i took away from living with old people all those years as a child is that i always thought that when i got older moths would be a much bigger issue my grandparents battled moths like their pensions were riding on it seriously there were so many mothballs piled in my grandfathers closet that i thought that when i got older moths might be a legitimate hurdle that i was supposed to overcome in my life at some point i thought they were to be feared i prepared for moths like a doomsday prepperif you would have asked me back then what do you want out of life sal i would have been like what do i want the same thing that you want go to school get a good education graduate go to college graduate from there get a good job with a good salary find a gal settle down have a couple kids everybodys healthy dont get overtaken by the mothshow much of a problem were moths that balls needed to be invented what was going on before the balls mayhem people roaming the streets glazed look on their face tattered clothing like dont go in there its a proper shit show and we dont yet have a solution hey dude i know you hate moths dont worry i invented balls cool bro those kill moths now no you just store them in your closet your closet will smell like piss and you wont want to go in it anymore what even do they do they dont kill moths they just smell like urinal cakes what kind of business model is that honestly at the end of the day whats worse someone being like oh my god sal you have a little hole in your lapel or lets make a run for it here comes the human golden shower just walk around smelling like piss give me the holesit also blows my mind that a moths food of choice is a shirt did you ever think about this they eat clothes and heres where it gets tricky for me moths were around before clothes so what did they eat then and how godawful was it that they were like give me slacks i know nothing of moths but there was one moth to be like yo bro i know youre chomping on that lard that you love but when youre done give me a shot i got something thats going to blow your balls off its called the poloi feared thermometers i feared moths thunder thunder debilitated me as a kid okay my mom when we had a bad storm my mom used to have to talk me down from the thunder and shed say honey dont worry about the thunder thats just god bowling youve heard that yeah youve heard that why are you applauding that why would you applaud that thats a sack of  lie right there why do we do that to children dont lie to me tell me the truth about thunder the truth isnt bad theres no need for a coverup just say its a cold front meeting a warm front boom boom you got some thunder there you tell me its god bowling i took that information to school i got my ass handed to me i walked into school that day like a confident meteorologist i was like you guys are scared of this thats just god and his goodtime pals tanya calm down thats just jesus engaging in light recreation you should be less concerned about the thunder and more concerned that hes up there taking a load off while you have crohnsim going to shoot my kid straight its the only way to go i think its a terrible thing to do to lie to them imagine explaining thunder to children in less fortunate areas or countries even like that like a third world country that would be insane honey i know youre scared right now were all scared this is the likes of a storm we have never seen and we are low on food and rations and medicines and the village is washing away and we havent seen your sister in quite some time but dont worry thats just god  bowling dont you dare trouble him with prayer right now hes a thunderbolt away from a turkeywhat is bowling honey bowling is the thing that the rich countries do where people wear shoes made of the hides of animals and they stand on polished wood and they throw a marble sphere down an alley to knock down ivory pins only to pick them right back up it doesnt sound real i know it is real honey god is whats not realoh i knew that would split the audience  however the joke is on you i am religious i say that to see where the pagans are i see you and i see you and i saw you so now i know no i was raised catholic i went to catholic school from kindergarten to senior year of college yes so i dont believe its not anything profound its just that if you believe in heaven you have to believe in hell thats the yinyang thats the rule they set up i dont want to believe in hell so i choose not to  god bowling we will say anything to kids we dont even care if it sounds believable in the least the tooth fairy the whole concept of the tooth fairy is cuckoo bananas it sounds like an acid trip you know when i found out about the tooth fairy the day i lost my first tooth not a year not a month they forgot to tell me i found out the day i lost it im six i have to process this information by nightfall i couldnt believe what i was hearing i was like dad lets just get this out of the way a woman is going to access the home this evening despite the locks to take a piece of my mouth and youre signing offmiddle of the night some noname hussy is going to saunter in here while im eyeballs deep in a rem cycle no name by the way no name thats not a red flag she only goes by her job title if i had someone walk up to me like hey im stan this is my wife regional manager id be suspect to stan and reggie right away i said dad why dont we put it in the mailbox clean transaction everybody wins he said she only flies here if its under the pillow i said she has wings i need to call jason jason was my best friend at the time i wanted to call him to warn him what would i even say jason listen theres not a lot of time a noname floozy is coming for your teeth tonight and the deadbolt dont mean i said dad we dont know this woman what if shes having a bad day she comes in here and starts taking other body parts like what if she got up on the wrong side of her cocoon and she comes in and just takes my kneecaps now i have no caps dad now i have no caps are they baby caps will i get these caps back dad how much will i get for these caps i had extensive questions about the capshe said shell give you a dollar i said a dollar why didnt you lead with that i was six it was  a dollar i felt like mark cuban i was like im going to buy a little league team with this money i would have gone to the playground like all your  is getting gum today i said you know lets try to go to sleep all right a dollar so that was the motivationi went to sleep fell asleep eventually and i woke up sometime in the middle of the night when i woke up i was frozen okay and i started to inch my hand up my body slowly as to not make a big fuss because i dont know what this woman is capable of and i reached around my neck and i felt paper and i pulled it out and it was a dollar and you would think from what i told you that i was happy i felt extremely violated i immediately went help shes in the housei heard my dads footsteps like he ran hes like whats the matter i go shes in the house she may still be in this house i said get my tooth back he couldnt calm me down hysterics he had to take me out of my bed at  in the morning he walked me down the hall to the kitchen and he showed me right on the kitchen counter was an envelope he opened it and my tooth was in it i believed in the tooth fairy for four hours he still couldnt calm me down and im like no im just crying im flailing hes like look at me stop hes like sal i just showed you the tooth youre okay i did that im the tooth fairy thats your tooth you dont have to worryyou got to understand something though i was six years old it was  am and i was dealing with a lot of trauma and i received that information not as there is no such thing as the tooth fairy i thought that he was telling me that my father was the fairy i went what do i call you now thats how confused i was i forgot about the fairy for a second and my main concern was how shall i address this man going forward everyone thinks theyre so progressive i was having the pronoun conversation  years ago thank you very muchi know now hes not the fairy hes one of our helpers  everything rattled me as a kid okay i was born in  and for most of the rhythm of  i was terrified that the rhythm was going to get me you could talk amongst yourselves you can explain it ill wait ill wait for you guys to just—if you dont know what im talking about there was a smash hit song in  called the rhythm is going to get you it was by gloria estefan and the miami sound machine its a very aggressive song my sister used to have the cassette tape and she used to play it over and over and overif you know the song if you dont know it if you havent heard it listen to it do me a favor as soon as you leave here tonight and i want you to listen to the lyrics because the lyrics are horrifying for a child this is how the song goes at night already scary when you turn off all the lights theres no place that you can hide the rhythm is going to get you the first time i heard that i was like yeah what the  did she just say im not preparedin bed throw the covers on your head and pretend like you are dead the  rhythms going to get you i dont know if she said  but she may as well have chicago i felt  no clue of whats happening to you but before this night is through oh baby the rhythm is going to get you thank you thank youall right and then the song continues as to taunt the child rhythm is going to get you rhythm is going to get you rhythm is going to get you the rhythm is going to get you im like when is this happening the songs like tonight im like yo tonight like in a little while sundown its the rhythm heretwo biggest things i was afraid of in  freddy krueger and the rhythm freddy krueger is a murdering child molester burnt head to toe to a crisp he has knives for fingers he comes back in your dreams to kill you and your loved ones you cant escape him i was afraid of that man and the rhythm i used to kiss my mom goodnight when i was little and for like six months in  id be like mom i love you i hope you sleep well also though might tonight be the night that the rhythm gets into the house and gets me specifically i give a  about my sister  that  she wants to play the tape over and over and summon the rhythm to our home i was like rhythm do me a favor you come to our house go down the hall make a hard right shes a toothless brunette underneath the hello kitty sheets with a death wish i want no part of thisagain my mom used to have to talk me down from it and she used to tell me honey dont worry about the rhythm its not coming for you its coming for all of us she doesnt do things the right way no no she was like honey dont worry about the rhythm its a phrase and when you get older you will understand but i promise you you are in no immediate danger and thats all i needed i trusted my mom that was fine put that to bed for me until the day that this woman used the rhythm against meme and my sister are fighting one day my moms like guys cut it out guys im not going to say it again and then she just went all right thats it and she turned in one motion and swiped the phone off the wall and she went hello the rhythms on the phone maybe dont laugh at that thats terrorism you know thats straightup domestic t i was a smartass when i was little and i was like how is the rhythm on the phone the phone didnt ringa couple of months later there we were fighting again and we were getting into it and my mom was like guys cut it out and she said guys dont make me say it again and then she went okay fine which i think is even scarier she walked to the wall like she had all the time in the world and she just picked up the phone and she looked at me and she dialed numbers and she waited and she went hello yes this is adele no he has not listened to me today at all yeah hes standing right here oh sure thank you so much and she puts the phone to me i took a deep breath released some urine i took a step toward the phone put it in my hand put it to my head my hand was trembling like this and i went hello who is this and the voice on the other line said this is the rhythmno that is very wrong you dont do that to a child my mother should be in jail straightup penitentiary for that woman you dont do that to a boy that affected me deeply how deeply it happened when i was  im  in chicago and were talking about itso i was a terrified kid i became a terrified adult i am terrified right now ill tell you about one of the most frightening things that happened to me in my adult life i used to live in this little studio basement apartment underneath like a townhouse and one day i was sleeping deep sleep all the lights pitch black and i heard a pounding at the door and you know you know you can tell when something is an emergency i heard like  and in one motion i left from a deep sleep to my feet and i was like hello my heart was beating out of my chest and i heard sal its dave open the doordave was my landlord hes the guy that lived upstairs from me at the time he was a big irish dude a new york city detective i stumbled in the dark to the door cracked it open just enough for the light to seep in i squinted whats updid you hear anything he asked urgentlyno i replied whats upyou didnt hear anything he pressedno whats going onhe explained i just got home my door upstairs is off the hinges somebody broke into my house and i think theyre still in there lets gohold on a second i pay you rent and now im drafted into this your tenant im a straightup civilian he didnt even wait for a response he walked away like i was automatically enlistedso i threw on my terry cloth bathrobe and house slippers—prime combat attire i suppose—and followed him to the front of the house sure enough i saw the door hanging precariously off the middle hinge it was chilling for a fleeting moment i thought oh we sure this isnt the tooth fairy i didnt want him to go in there and shoot my fatherwere standing there and in a moment of sheer intensity he reaches into his jacket pulls out a gun and cocks it now i know you guys are from here but im from there im not used to seeing a gun right in front of my face let alone cocked and ready with a serious face he says to me im going to go inside and secure the first floor you get my backand i said im your guy i dont know why i said that im not his guy im nobodys guy im barely a guyhe goes in methodically technically its like something out of a tv show hes sweeping the rooms moving with precision im standing there like an extra waiting for my cue head to toe in south park pajamas terry cloth bathrobe the only thing i can do is mimic him hed say kitchens clear and id echo my kitchens clear closets clear id follow with all clear in the closethe comes up to me and says ive canvassed the first floor were good down here now you and i have to go upstairs and for some reason i repeated still your guywe start ascending the steps and the tension is palpable hes stonefaced ready to act making not a single creek on the steps im right behind him mimicking every move head to toe in south park pajamas and terry cloth bathrobe i even felt compelled to do this  with my hand thinking maybe the robber would believe i had a weapon toowe reach the top of the steps three doors two are open—ones a half bath the others a spare bedroom one door is closed meaning if anyone is in the house theyre behind that door everything is going to happen right nowi know were laughing but i want you to appreciate the gravity try to put yourself in my slippers ive been awake for  seconds and now i could get shot dave starts doing hand signals intricate ones im like why would you believe that i can interpret this can we please go downstairs and whisper about itbefore i can communicate that i dont know what im supposed to do he kicks his own door open it flies back and he rushes in with his gun drawn a surge of adrenaline coursed through me i felt something come up my toes and out the top of my head and i involuntarily yelled pow powpow pow i made the sound of a gun from cartoons thats how i helped that man an onomatopoeia he didnt get shot but could you imagine if he had and the footage was on the news local  shot dead making gun sounds id be on camera yes i said pow pow there was nobody in theredave didnt turn around for ten seconds his back was shaking with silent laughter finally he turned and just said pow pow i was like dave i did all that i couldtwo weeks later he raised my rent by amsterdam—that was scary but it was nothing compared to the handsdown worst experience of my life the worst night of my life i was in amsterdam with my girlfriend on vacation a few years back we came out of the van gogh museum it was getting dark and we had no plans what are we going to do tonight we wondered by chance across the

leaving the audience in stitches  ♪how we doing chicagohow we doing vic theatre its so wonderful to be with you tonight its so wonderful to be with you guys im gonna get right into it im having a crisis of confidence im having a crisis of confidence because my sixyearold has recently started saying something thats funnier than any joke ive written in the past year when my sixyearold has to pee he comes over and says i have to pee when my sixyearold has to poop he comes over and he whispers in my ear i have a secret thats brown its perfect no notes because what else could it possibly be i have a secret thats brown let me guess you got to poop no moms having an affair with the ups guyand look its great anytime youre a parent and your kid says something funny its so much better if youre a comedian because the minute he said it i couldnt wait to get out on stage and tell it to you because thats the thing the most important thing to me is that my kids are happy but i also love when theyre material to put it in a simpler way i want them to be content but i also want them to be content i did a special called lobby baby because my second–  thank youmy second was born in the lobby of our apartment building it was an incredible story but even more than that do you know what sound it makes when youre a comedian and your child is born in the lobby of an apartment building chafuckingching like as far as im concerned lobby baby has paid for college secret thats brown on his way thats not enough for a fouryear accredited university but its a couple of semesters at devryi am gonna talk a fair amount about having kids tonight and i appreciate that not everyone here is a parent we do have a pretty cool consolation prize for you which is this– at the end of the night you all get to go back to a home where no fucking kids live so that–thats pretty great you can go binge a show whatever that means bingeing a show my wife and i are so tired not only do we not binge shows i would describe the way we watch television as microdosing we watch  minutes of an episode at a time my wife falls asleep after the first five minutes but im not allowed to turn it off because the sudden drop in volume will wake her up so i just have to slowly bring down the volume continuing to watch while the characters just get quieter and quieter which i think is what its like to watch tv when youre having a strokeand then the next night i have to go back and watch those five minutes again i start with that basically what im saying is for us to finish an episode of television it takes like three and a half months im gonna talk about my kids so i should tell you their names my kids are named ashe axel and addie and independently those are all great names together it is a disasterits such a weird mean thing to do to grandparents to bring over three kids and be like here are your grandkids ah ah ah theyre just– old people need words that sound massively different in their pronunciation its why lipitor doesnt rhyme with arsenic you need a safety buffer im not gonna tell you whose idea it was to give all three of our kids a names i will only tell you that my name is seth and my wifes name is alexia lot of times people say oh alexi you must get her name mixed up with the kids names as well because its also an a name and i dont i would say the hardest thing about having a wife named alexi is how often our alexa thinks im talking to it and making matters worse i only use my wifes first name when were fighting and im being passive aggressive which means our alexa often says things like im sorry i dont know what you mean by we all cant be as perfect as youim raising kids in new york city i love raising kids in new york city one thing of course though when youre raising kids in new york city or any city is you have to be cognizant of safety all the time i walk my boys to school every day and from a very young age we came up with something when we cross the street which is wed walk up to the curb and we would look at the cross lightand if it was a red hand all three of us would say red hand and wed stop and if it was a green man all three of us would say green man and then wed cross the street and i enjoyed it and the boys were tickled by it and passers by seemed delighted by the whole show and so it was just greatand then the other day my wife was with us and she looked up at the cross light and she said you know its actually more white than green and i said yeah i dont know how good id feel about me and the boys all announcing white man before we cross the street making matters worse my boys walk and talk like this white manmake way for white man motorists and cyclists take heed for there is white man in the thoroughfare safe passage is our birthright i would describe being a parent as just constantly suppressing your true self heres a good example when youre a parent you have to watch your language all the time and i do i try very hard to watch my language in front of my kidshowever with that said i sometimes feel i dont get enough credit for the first word i wanted to say like for example the other day i was in the kitchen all the kids were within earshot and i put my hand on the stove and i burned it and i went goddamn it and my wife looked at me as if to say you need to do a better joband i agree with that but at the same time i wanted to gather the entire family around and say you guys know the word daddy wanted to say was motherfucker right and when you have motherfucker locked and loaded you cant downshift all the way to rats you just cant do it at my age id throw my back out if i did thatif you ever see daddy wearing a neck brace know he wanted to scream son of a bitch and instead said sassafras you never want to say a bad word in front of your children because then your spouse will blame you for it every time they say it for the rest of their life the nice thing though is you can tell based on how a kid says a word where they learned the wordlike for example you can tell when your kids learned a bad word at school like the other day one of our kids came home and he just danced through the living room going shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit and my wife looked at me like it was my fault and im like he didnt get that from me ive never stubbed my toe and then done like a kick ball chain across the roomjust as easily however you can tell when they learned it from you the other day my son was building a lego set and it was at the dining room table and the whole thing collapsed and when it collapsed he went like this ugh fuck this i was like thats me that was from me that looked exactly like me that was like looking into a mirrorits not just profanity that is ugly coming out of the mouths of children there are certain words that were always telling our kids not to say disgusting is a word were always begging them not to say stupid were always telling them dont say stupid the biggest one is hate kids will say all day long that they hate things and were just like dont say hatesay you dont like say you dont care for and we really try to drill that through their heads and then the other day one of my boys ran into our bedroom and he was like hey dad you know who i hate and i said buddy we dont say hate we say we dont like we say we dont care for and then i could tell he was upsetso i said who were you gonna say and he said i was gonna say the guy who killed martin luther king and then i immediately was like oh no please definitely say hate for that the last thing i want is my kid walking around town being like you know who i never cared for james earl ray the man was not my cup of teanow if youll excuse me i see my light has changed white man i could never hate my kids i could never hate my kids you guys i could never hate my kids with that said i do think its healthy– i do think its healthy to keep a mental list of the three things theyre currently doing that i hate the most i hate how they roll dicethey cant keep two dice on the table to save their lives and the minute they start their roll you know youre like youre coming in too hot theyll say how does monopoly work im like heres how it works keep both dice on the table you win try to remember were in a breakfast nook not the craps table at the bellagioheres my impression of me playing board games with my kids and then sometimes after i get the die ill just stay there for a minute you know because they dont know that i have it and its just kind of peaceful to be under the couch ill kick my legs a little bit so they know im alive ill just rest theremake eye contact with the spider hello friend do you have children i hate the way they roll dice i hate when they wake up in the middle of the night my kids are at the age now where theyre having nightmares and when they have nightmares they will come to our room and when they come to our room my wife and i know that one of us is gonna have to be up for the next hour trying to coax them back to sleepand its gotten to the point– this is so traumatic for me that its gotten to the point that when i hear the doorknob rattle i actually think to myself maybe ill get lucky and its just an intruder maybe its just an intruder who will politely steal my valuables and then i wont have to scratch his back for the next hourmade a terrible decision last summer last summer my son had a nightmare and he couldnt get back to sleep and i said how about i scratch your back buddy maybe thatll help and now–you guys now i think he likes the back scratches so much that hes making up the nightmares cause hes coming into my room and he does not have the energy of a kid who has actually been spooked hes like bad news skeleton man came back good news ive already pulled my shirt upi do have a good parenting hack if you have a kid whos always asking to get their back scratched what you do is you take a little piece of masking tape and you just slap it over their mouths i hate how they roll dice i hate when they wake me up in the middle of the night im gonna take a knee for the third one i hate how much they talk about lavathey talk about lava all the time i blame the schools i get it youre trying to teach science to young kids youre gonna talk about volcanoes youre gonna talk about lavas but then they come home and they have all these lava questions and you guys i dont know anything about lava the only thing i know about lava is if they see it up close ive done a bad job as a fatheri cant tell you how many times ive been trying to parallel park the car into a tiny spot and as im looking back i just see two dumb faces looking at me and theyre like if you touch lava do you die i could never hate my kids i could never hurt my kids i could never hurt my kids you guys i could never hurt my kidsi will admit every now and then i do pull off one of their sweaters as fast as i can if its the end of a long day and they wont even do me the courtesy of helping me get them undressed i will take every top layer theyre wearing and yank it upwards because– and it brings me great shame to say it– this moment gives me joywhen it catches when it catches like this when i clockwork orange my children into seeing what theyve done to me its not permanent it always goes right back down you know i will say your perspective on almost everything changes once you have kids and again mine are eight six and twoand i will say something that has become very haunting to receive in the mail for us is a wedding invitation because one of two things can happen when we receive a wedding invitation the first thing is that the wedding invitation says were encouraging people not to bring their children and that means we have to find child care for an evening or sometimes a whole weekend and thats badbut what is worse is when they say were inviting your whole family to witness our special day and that is only something that a dumb unmarried couple would think is a good idea a dumb unmarried childless couple would think its a good idea to have kids witness your special day cause they dont know yet that kids will ruin any day special or otherwiseand when i have three young kids at a wedding im just dreading the moment that im gonna have to go out on the dance floor interrupt the fatherdaughter dance and be like hi im so sorry to interrupt congratulations sir she makes a beautiful bride hey our kids ate your cake they ate the whole cake i dont know what to say the cake is gone and i can tell its a really expensive cakebut its kind of your fault because we never should have been here and anyway if youre thinking im not gonna be punished im gonna be punished cause my kids ate a whole giant cake so that means theyre gonna be up all night and theyre gonna be shitting all morning the kids ate the cakethank you by the way for making them wear tiny tuxedos you dont know this yet about kids but their favorite thing in the world to do is go to a formal wear place while a guy tells them to stand still with pins in his mouth thank you for that thank you for the tiny tuxedoswe should have bought one cause i cant imagine it would have been less expensive than how fucking expensive it was to rent anyways my wifes in the car she wanted me to say goodbye shes passive aggressively looking at her phone cause i guess right before she went to the bathroom she said dont let the kids eat the cake and thats exactly what had happenedso now she might never talk to me again but i want you to know i hope you stay married forever and if you dont stay married forever and get divorced im gonna come and take a dump on your lawn thank you good nightbeautiful bride can we admit now that having to show a vaccine card to get into a restaurant during covid was not in fact like living in germany during world war ii can we admit that now because you guys every single time i had to show my vaccine card to get into a restaurant the host or the hostess was so apologetictheyre like were so sorry can we just take a quick look at your vaccine card or if you have a picture of your vaccine card on your phone or if you want to take a picture of my vaccine card and just show it back to me or if you can just prove to me that your phone can take pictures thats more than enough for us to get you to your tableand ive seen a lot of movies about germany during world war ii and i dont remember a single scene where the gestapo behaved that way i dont remember a single scene where the gestapo kicked in the door and was like we demand to see your papers and we are so sorry that we are still doing this whole see your papers things this is so irritating to us too this is like for real our least favorite part about being in ze gestapo its just our boss is such a nazi that is a very offensive german accent that is a cartoonishly bad german accent and recently i did a show and there was a german audience member and afterwards they came up to me and they said do you often do a german accent on stage and i said yes i enjoy doing a german accent on stage and they said how would you feel if you saw a german comedian doing an american accent on stage and i said im never gonna see a german comedianlike what is the series of events that would have to go wrong in my life for me to like walk into a club as someone on stage is like make some noise for klaus and then im like ill stick around for this and then im sitting in my seat and all of a sudden hes like and then americans are like i would like  chicken mcnuggets and im like we dont sound like thatanyway after that very rude answer he regrouped and he said well how about this would you do an african accent on stage and i said dear god no i would never do an african accent on stage and he said where is the line and i said where is the line for what accents a white comedian can do in  the borders of europe thats the line from finland to italy from portugal to ukrainei wouldnt fuck with turkey thats the line and you can have a healthy comedy career here ill show you how it works heres my impression of a swedish person ordering from a chinese waiter yes hello do you have the chicken chow mein tonight no were out of that i chose swedish on purpose because im almost certain its impossible to do an offensive swedish accent and im basing that entirely on the fact that the muppet show never got canceled how was that ok how was the swedish chef ok schmorgedy borgedy borgedythat was– that was–as a child that was my introduction to swedish people thats how i thought they all behaved i thought they were imbeciles who were bad with cutlery schmorgedy borgedy borgedy can you imagine– what would it have sounded like if theyd taken the same approach with the pakistani chefim not gonna do it but at least now i know what the sound of  buttholes closing at the same time is fwup my kids are really lucky they have all four grandparents in their lives and they see them all the time in person but they also see them all the time on facetime theyre interacting with them every dayits so unlike how i talk to my grandparents my dad put me on the phone with my grandmother once a year the way a kidnapper would put a hostage on the phone with the police he would say say hello to your grandmother id like hello and then hed grab the phone back hes like now you know the boys alive put  in a birthday card and leave it under the highway overpassi love having my parents around my kids its one of the most special things you can experience in life i love it so much the only thing thats hard is that your parents are always gonna have a different parenting style from when they did it to the parenting style that youre currently using nowagain my dad was a dad of young kids a long time ago but he was an oldschool screamer my dad would yell at me and my brother and we were not a threestrike family we were a onestrike family if you disobeyed he would just start laying into youand we have a much more modern nonconfrontational parenting style we never yell we use language like– when theyre misbehaving we say i can see youre upset right now and while i dont want to invalidate the very real feelings youre having i do encourage you to work through it on a timeline thats conducive to your schedule while remembering the most important thing this is just as much your house as it is oursand sometimes my dad comes over and he reverts to his old ways and he tells the kids to stop doing something and they dont and then he just starts screaming at them and when my dad yells at my kids i immediately intervene i always run over im like dad that is not our way that is your way and while i would never want to invalidate your way or make you feel less than–but i have to admit something to you guys when my dad yells at my kids i always tell him to stop but also there is a tiny voice in the back of my head that always wants to scream give em hell old man let em know how good they have itcause guys i got to admit something im not sure our modern parenting style is working im not seeing the daytoday results like the other day my eightyearold just bit my sixyearold just fully bit him they werent even wrestling he just saw him across the roomand i just watched him like think like im gonna go bite him right now he was like a robot that was like initiate biting protocol and he went over and he bit him so hard and then he said i didnt bite him and i was like look at the teeth marks i could take your brothers arm to an orthodontist right now and they could fit you for invisalignand i was so mad i never do this i grabbed my son and i said youre gonna have a timeout in the other room and i put him in a room and i slammed the door and my plan was just to make him spend five minutes thinking about how badly he behaved just five minutes reflecting on the consequences of his actionsbut im such a modern wuss i could only make it like two and a half minutes before i started thinking oh my god hes gonna be in therapy the rest of his life this is a trauma hell never recover from i have to go in and let him know hes my little slugger and im always gonna love him no matter whatand i opened the door expecting to see him in a puddle in the middle of the room on the floor and not only was he not there he was leaning against the window looking out across the city not a care in the world he looked like he was in a french new wave film all that was missing was a beret and a cigarette did i bite him perhaps but in life youre either the biter or ze bitter ill tell you this i have a theory guys my theory is this i think my kids are gonna yell at their kids i think it skips a generation and i think at night my boys are in their bunk bed talking about it and saying when i grow up im not gonna do that ineffective bullshit dad does im gonna get loud like grandpa and the other was ones like oh totally im not gonna be a beta cuck like dad invalidate your feelings bitch grow upmy wife thinks the world can help us be better parents and shes always sending me instagram videos of instagram moms who are trying to share their wisdom my take is if they look too well put together i just think they have different kinds of kids than ourslike if they have a blowout and a ring light im just like i dont think this is meant for us and they often have very cryptic advice my wife sent me one where it was a woman just very calmly saying positive feedback is really important for a child if you tell your child in the morning that you like their handwriting theyre less likely to punch a sibling at nightnow i dont know if thats true or not because i never remember it until its too late like theyll just be wailing on each other in the corner and i run over and im like i like your handwritingthere is–there is an instagram mom i really like a style of instagram mom its the one whos like barely keeping it together and theyre shooting their video like blair witch project style on their phone and theyre like hiding in the closet before their kids can find themtheyre like hi i dont have a lot of time we figured out a way to get sharpie off wallpaper what you have to do is– oh no they found memy wife and i are both incredibly close with our parents and i think its one of the first things we connected on we thought if we started our own family maybe we would have kids that wanted to hang out as much with us as we want to hang out with our parentswith that said our families also have some differences for example when i was growing up the rule at the dinner table was never speak unless spoken to if you do speak have it be relevant to the conversation at hand and certainly never talk until the person who is currently talking has finished whereas i feel like in my wifes family the rule was as soon as you think something say it out loudideally try to start saying it before you finish thinking it try to hear the completed thought outside your head with your ears for the very first timeanother cool thing my wifes family does is they will call a restaurant to order delivery and its only when theyre on the phone with the restaurant that they ask everybody else what they want they will lowkey criticize the restaurant on the phone with the restaurant theyll be like should we get the dumplings and from across the room someone will be like no their dumplings are soggy were not gonna get the dumplingsmy wifes family is jewish which i havent said yet but i have told you if theres one thing jewish people agree on i would love to know what that is i really want to stress these jokes are all prosemitici love my jewish wife i love my jewish children i have incredible inlaws the best thing about my inlaws is theyre very easy to find if youre ever looking for them theyre in the middle of my fucking business knockwe have a tricky conversation coming up with our children because my wifes grandparents were holocaust survivors and obviously thats something were going to have to explain to them one daythe problem with kids is sometimes they will ask you a question before youre prepared on how to answer it and they sort of force your hand and the other day my wife said to one of our sons youre so lucky you know all four of your grandparents your grandmother didnt know any of her grandparentsand he said what happened to them and she said they all died in a war and he said were they soldiers and she said not everyone who dies in a war is a soldier and then he paused for a second and said oh were they drummersbecause hed seen a revolutionary war picture book and quite smartly may i say deduced that while the soldiers are obviously in grave danger these drummers up front are dead menwhat a bad time to be good at drumming the revolutionary war maybe the worst time ever to be good at drumming and i bet when you heard word that they were looking for drummers you got so excited youre like oh my god thats great we dont have to fight well stay back and rehearse for a concertand then whenever the survivors get here well do a gig for them and so they raise their hand they were like i know how to drum and theyre like great go strap it on and stand up front and they were like up front and theyre like yeah its gonna be you another drummer and a flute guyand the flute guy was like actually its a fife and theyre like not now flute guymy wife argues that i should convert to judaism her argument is everybody already assumes that im jewish– not a bad argument im a quarter jewish every jewish person ive ever met has said youre jewish rightim also a quarter swedish not one swedish person has ever said schmorgedy borgedy borgedy borgthats how they talk guys im not gonna apologize for how they talk why would the muppet show lie to me thats how swedish people talkand this is how lab assistants talk– me me me me me me mei recently found out some things about my lineage because i did this incredible show on pbs called finding your roots with professor henry louis gates its a wonderful show great show hes a brilliant man and i found out some things about my family that i hadnt known beforei found out i had descended from lithuanian jews lithuanian jews famous for coining the expression we got to get the fuck out of lithuaniabut i was a bad subject for the show finding your roots because i am not easily shocked or amazed and the best thing about that show is when they reveal information to you about your lineage and you are shocked and amazedand because im not easily shocked and amazed it was just a bad episode like for example at one point henry louis gates looked at me and said we tracked down one of your ancestors to the year  we found their name written in a town ledger from the year  how does that make you feel knowing we tracked back a relative of yours to the year and all i could manage was well i mean i knew i came from people its not like he was like your greatgreatgrandmother was a mermaidhe did shock me once but it was by accident you sit across from him and theres a table between you and on the table is a big book full of information and he tees up the story and when he tees up the story he asks you to turn the page to reveal the informationand at one point he said to me youre a performer and i said im a performer he said do you anyone else in your family tree whos a performerand i go i dont know a single other person in my family tree who is a performer and he said why dont you turn the page because i think the next thing youre gonna see is pretty coolso i turn the page and it was a newspaper obituary about my greatgrandfather who had died from suicide and henry louis gates goes what does it sayand i said oh exactly that i go my greatgrandfather it seems he died by suicide and henry louis gates to his credit just looked at me and said thats a mistake i apologize were gonna edit this outand then he said why dont you turn another page so i turned another page and im like oh my grandfather was in a school playand he said pretty cool right and i was like henry you cant bounce back from accidentally showing someone a suicide obituarythat would be like if a magician was like is this your card and youre like no i think thats a picture of your dick oh fuck shit shit shit shit shitis this your card nine of spades is this your card youre still thinking about the dick pic yeah yeah dudethis is the time of the night where a lot of comedians will start doing their antitrans material im happy to inform you i have no antitrans material i have nothing but love and respect for the trans communityand also im always so frustrated when people frame it as how its inconvenient to them when someone transitions when they talk about how they have to learn a new name or a new pronoun or they have to change a contact in their email address folderand really if were being honest– lets be honest for a second what would actually be harder for you if someone in your life decided they were transitioning to a new gender or if someone in your life decided that as of tomorrow they were going to be a veganlike what makes your life harder tomorrowbecause you guys five years ago my brother decided to be a vegan and ive spent multiple thanksgivings with him and i  would prefer my next thanksgiving start with my dad walking in and saying im a lady now– than i would spending another thanksgiving where my brother keeps asking me is there butter in thisim like theres fucking butter in everything that is the true meaning of thanksgiving is butter in everything thats how the first thanksgiving startedthe indigenous people came over they were like this is maize and the pilgrims said what if we put butter on it and call it cornand the indigenous people were like oh my god this is so much better how can we ever repay you and the pilgrims were like we have an idea but were not gonna tell you yet white manmy brother whos hardcore– my brother will not eat honey my brother said that vegans who eat honey are called beegansi found out he didnt eat honey because one day he was over at my apartment and i just sort of threw a granola bar at him because he looked like he was starving and he picked it up and he just started reading the labelif there was a logo for veganism it should be someone at your home reading a label found a problemby the way i wish i could be a vegan every argument for being a vegan is a good one its better for the environment its more humanethe best argument though is this you guys my brother looks so much healthier than i do like if you saw a picture of my brother and i next to each other you would stop eating meat yesterdaylike he glows like the sun and next to him i look like a guy holding a lantern at the bow of a ferry im like– the fog is thick but well make it throughi mentioned my inlaws earlier and i want to give a special– pay a little special attention to my wonderful motherinlaw i really do have the greatest motherinlaw in the worldand my favorite thing about her is there are also times that she agrees with me that my wife is being a lot sometimes my wife and i will be fighting in front of my motherinlaw and she will just make eye contact with me from across the room as if to say sorrybut it has to be nonverbal it is only of value to me if it is a nonverbal acknowledgment of my wifes behaviorif she actually speaks up in my defense thats a disaster for me because every married person here knows that its always just easiest to agree with your spouse when theyre complaining about somethingand i cannot tell you how many times its been the end of the night and were getting ready for bed and my wife will say can you believe my mom says i have to be nicer to youand my only response is yeah what a bitch mind your own business ladyi do have a mean wife you guys– but only to me my wife is mean to me and she is so nice to the kids and that is so much better than the other way aroundif my wife was nice to me but mean to the kids my life would be a nightmare i would come home and theyd always run over and be like hey man you got to step in and do something were your kids tooand id be like shh dont talk to me i dont want her to know were friendsi–by the way this is not an attack on my wife this is a defense of her meanness my wife works so hard she has three children she is so depletedshe has a fulltime job my wife is a lawyer my wife passed the new york bar she is a brilliant woman the new york bar thats the hardest one thats the one giuliani passedso i get it she is tired all the time and shes so patient with her children and sometimes she has to take it out on meand also i deserve it you guys i am so irritating here are some of the things i do here are some of the things i do that earn her meannesswere on our third kid i still dont know how to collapse the stroller no idea i look at a stroller the way a dog would if you told him to do origamii have no idea how to fold up the stroller ill just like wiggle it ill shake it a little bithey quick question for the women here have you ever while watching your husband try to collapse the stroller thought to yourself i cant believe i ever thought this man could satisfy me sexuallylike while hes like i think i got it i almost got it are you like theres a buttonits like no i think its almost there just a few more pumpsyou want to hear something heartbreaking the first time my wife heard me tell that joke hardest shes ever laughedshe laughed a hurtful amount she screamed from the audience amen brother preachthats not to say my wife is perfect there are a few things i would change about her as wellif i could change something about my wife i would try to improve her skills as a directional speakermy wife says important things to me all the time with her back to me while shes walking out of the room without raising her voice at all shell say things like the gas company was here today they say theres a toxic–so we have this fight all the time where shell be like remember were having dinner with the harrises in an hour and im like when did you tell me thatand shes like monday when i whispered it into the mailboxanother thing i would change about my wife is her caffeinated beverage of choicemy wifes caffeinated beverage of choice is a matcha latte if you dont know what that is ill tell you what its not– available at the coffee place you are going toits such a rude thing to ask for when someones like were getting coffee what do you want it would be like if youre like hey were ordering pizza can we get you anything a quiche lorrainetheyre not gonna have that it doesnt hurt to ask it does hurt to ask i dont want to look like a lunatici think my wife likes matcha lattes because they are hard to get and the reason i say that is my wifes love language is acts of servicedo you guys know the concept of love languages heres the concept of love languages for those of you who dont knowthere are five love languages this is how people receive love theres acts of service touch quality time gifts and words of encouragementand guys i dont know who came up with this list all i know is that their love language is definitely acts of service because this is the biggest scam ever that acts of service is lumped on this list with the other four reasonable thingsheres life if your love language is touch and your wife is acts of servicewhen i get home i would like a hug i need you to fix the boilerquality time want to go for a walk yeah after you clean out the guttersits like if an airlines loyalty program was like we have gold platinum silver and when we land you clean the planethis is all– what ive been doing is all a very good example of how it is hard to be married to a comediani just get to come up here and tell you guys what im thinking about my marriage and so yes it is hard to be married to a comedianbut guys its also very hard to be a comedian who is marriedand what i mean by that is when youre married the right thing to do when youre having an argument is always say the thing that will most quickly deescalate the situationbut when youre a comedian those arent the things that pop into your headwhen youre a comedian in the middle of an argument all you ever think is this is a funny thing i could say that will make it worseheres an example a recent examplemy boys love superheroes and theyre always asking me questions about superheroestheyll say who would win a fight between batman and spiderman whos stronger the hulk or thorand the other day they said whos faster superman or the flashand thats an ageold comic book question i was so proud of them for even coming up with itand i said you know what let me check on youtubeand sure enough there was a threeminute clip from a justice league cartoon of superman racing the flashand i said you know what lets watch itnow the important part of this story is our kids do not have a lot of screen time i dont say that to be like were better parents than anyone here i just mean that our kids will turn out better than yoursso– i got one boy on each knee and i got my phone out and were watching superman race the flashand my wife walks in and she says what are you doingand i say were watching superman race the flashand she says a cartoonand i couldnt help myselfand i said no the real guysisnt that crazy they got the real guys and they werent even trying to get the real– it was like a nature crew documentary in the desert and then they saw this like blue and red voom voom and they were like did we just–i mean shed left the room shed walked out being like i cant believe my mom says i got to be nice to this–heres another recent examplewe were going on vacation and we were leaving new york cityand we were going through securityand the tsa agent found a tub of hummus in my wifes carryonand they took it out and they said you cant bring hummus on the planeand my wife said ive brought hummus on the plane before which was less convincing than she thought it would bebecause their answer to that was you cant bring hummus on the planeand my wife said but its not a liquidand they said its also not a solidand it turns out in cases like this the tie goes to the tsa agentand look i was on my wifes sidei mean everybodys bringing hummus on planes why are they singling her outevery time you go on a plane these days you walk down the aisle five seven tubs of hummusbut they took her hummusand then we were walking and she was upsetand she said to me can you believe thatand i said no but i didnt say which part i hadnt believed id been honest without being truthfuland that would be the end of that story but we had to fly back to new yorkand on the way back my wife stopped on the way to the airport at a whole foods and bought a tub of hummus same size if not even a little bit biggerand they found it againthis time they found it in the whole foods bag which is what you call asking for itand they pulled it out and they said to my wife you cant bring hummus on the planeand she said ive brought hummus on the plane before conveniently leaving out what had happened the most recent beforeand still they took her hummusand then we walked throughand we were walking and i could tell she was upsetand i knew i shouldnt say anythingi knew the right path forward was just to keep my mouth shut but i couldnt help myselfand i turned to her with a big smile and said well youll get them next timeshe is here tonight by the wayshes not here are you crazyshes here and im gonna tell the hummus story we havent talked about sinceill tell you this i know my wife shes a substantial woman shes got grit shes got determinationthe next time we fly shes getting hummus on a plane i believe in her i believe shes gonna get hummus on the plane shes gonna go to the airport shes gonna unzip her carryon and shes gonna take out a bag of chickpeas and a muddler and shes gonna look that tsa agent in the eye and be like officer i think everything here is legal and above board and theyre just gonna nod cause they know theyve lost and then in deference to her victory all of the tsa in the airport is gonna stand to make a gate for her to walk through theyre gonna hold up their magnetic wands like swords and shes gonna walk through the airport underneath the magnetic wands and passengers are gonna scream her name and throw pita chips at her feet like rose petals and then shes gonna get on the plane and were gonna sit down and shes gonna finish making her concoction and shes gonna say to the kids who wants hummus and theyre all gonna say we hate hummus and im gonna whisper dont care forso my kids have never watched my show but i recently brought my kids to the show because we had our tenth anniversary show and we had president joe biden on the show thank you very kind we had president biden on the show and i thought you know what whens the next time im gonna have my kids be in the position to meet the president and you know i might not want them to meet the next one so i said you know what lets– lets bring the kids in to meet the president and the best thing about watching my kids meet the president is not how the president behaved but rather how each of my children acted differently based on their personality first up was my oldest and my oldest is just– hes the sweetest boy in the world and hes just trying so hard like a lot of oldest siblings he just wants to be the best kid he can be so anyway he picked out his outfit and he wore his nicest clothes from his picture day and he just walked into the room and he was like hello mr president my name is ashe nice to meet you and i was just so proud of him like my heart broke at how wonderfully he had performed next up was my middle son he was born in the lobby of an apartment building and behaves like it every day of his life i dont–cant quite explain what that is i just know that even if you didnt know who he was if you saw him across the room youd be like i think that one was born in a lobby he picked out his outfit as well he wore a train conductors jacket and a pair of raybans and he literally danced into the room and when he danced into the room my oldest was so embarrassed he like cocked his fist back and then he remembered that earlier that morning i told him he had good handwriting and he was like– so my middle dances in the room and just starts singing ♪ joe biden joe biden joe biden ♪ and he gets right next to him and he screams in the presidents face youre my favewhit pwesident and joe biden was so taken aback because i dont even think joe biden is joe bidens favorite president he looked at me like have you not told him about obama because he would– if he likes me he would love obamaand then the best though was my daughter addie two and a half and the president was incredible with her it was really something to see his sweetness he sat on the couch so that he was at eye level with her and she walked over and he reached into a bag and he pulled out a stuffed commander the white house dog and he didnt know this but in january i had gone to the white house and i had left with three stuffed commanders and i had given them to my children but he reached into the bag and he held it out to addie and he went like  he said i got this for you and she just looked at it and then she looked at him and said i got that and he said you have one of these and she goes yeah i got that at home and hes just holding it and he goes you want another one and she goes no and ive been so worried about that interaction all day because my daughter is a huge trump supporter and–and not on social issues its all tax stuff with her shes nato she feels like the nato countries dont pay enough dont get into it with her if you see heri have a weird thing happening which is i grew up in the suburbs all i ever wanted to do was live in new york city my kids live in new york city all they want to do is live in the suburbs like we visit my parents my parents live in the same house i grew up in in a nondescript new hampshire suburb and every time we leave my kids are basically like when are you gonna make enough money to buy a house like this because we live in new york and nothing about new york makes sense to kids theres none of the appeal of new york appeals to them theyre never like well sure grandma and grandpa have a front and back yard but we can walk to the theateri have one of those new york city apartments if you ever lived in new york youd be like this is a great apartment if you lived anywhere else in the world youd be like i guess so here are some of the features about my very expensive new york city apartment its never fully dark its never fully quiet we live near a university so every other night at  in the morning you hear someone yell something like krista says shell meet us there and whoever the krista news is being yelled at does not hear it the first time so theyre like kristas not with us and so then the first person has to be like no krista says shell meet us there and it takes everything in my power not to open up the window and be like you guys kristas dead krista died its like so sad you guys but shes deaddo we have heat in our apartment yeah we have exposed radiators and the best thing about them is theyre so hot that when you touch it you dont burn yourself you just die theyre like lava that way i think ive been told our radiators are the feature of a prewar building im not sure which war they were talking about theyre not the only prewar feature in our apartment building we also have a neighbor across the hall who could definitely find prussia on a map and much like prussia after world war ii she also doesnt have boundariesthe other day i was trying to get my son out the door to school and i got him into the hallway and he was just having one of those rough mornings that kids have and i got him in the hallway and then he sort of wrestled his way free of me and he ran into the apartment and then i chased him in with his shoes in my hand and i left the door open and i finally managed to get him in a chair and im trying to get his shoes on and im upset and hes crying and were just having a really bad morning and then all of a sudden we hear–♪ hush little baby ♪♪ dont say a word ♪and we turn around and our neighbor has just wandered through the open door into our apartment wearing a nightgown the color of which i would describe as victorian apparition ghost of girl who drowned in town well and i love that she was in her apartment and she heard a kid crying and she goes i know what calms kids down the haunted nursery rhymes they sing in horror movie trailers but there is a very happy ending to that story and its what im gonna leave you with because in that moment when our neighbor walked in my son and i locked eyes and i realized he was thinking the exact same thing that i was thinking because he looked at her and then he looked at me and he said fuck this and i said you just paid for college buddythank you so much
